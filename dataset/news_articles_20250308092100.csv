Reform UK refers MP Rupert Lowe to police,"Reform UK says it has suspended MP Rupert Lowe and referred him to police, alleging he made threats of physical violence against party chairman Zia Yusuf. In a statement with chief whip Lee Anderson, Yusuf also said the party had received allegations of bullying in Lowes parliamentary and constituency offices. The party has appointed a lawyer to conduct an investigation into allegations of workplace bullying made by two female employees, he added. Writing on social media platform X, Lowe said the partys allegations were untrue and false and he was disappointed, but not surprised to read them. He added there was zero credible evidence against him and he was seeking legal advice immediately. Lowe said his suspension was a reaction to having criticised party leader Nigel Farage in a newspaper interview. Reform, the successor to Farages Brexit Party, has been riding high in recent polls - but this is a spectacular and very public explosion of divisions at the top of the party. The party had only five MPs in the Commons, and Lowes suspension means it has now lost one. In an interview with the Daily Mail earlier this week, Lowe had said the party remained a protest party led by the Messiah under Farages leadership. Farage, he added, would need the right people around him to deliver the goods as party leader. Farage hit back in an interview, saying Lowe was completely wrong and Reform UK was absolutely not a protest party. A spokesman for Reform UK confirmed it had withdrawn the party whip from him, meaning he will not sit as part of the partys group in Parliament and becomes an independent MP. In response, Lowe said: I asked reasonable and constructive questions of Nigel Farage and Reforms leadership, following months of pushing for progress behind closed doors. The day after, I find a knife in my back over false allegations. Whip suspended. A Reform UK source denied the announcement of its investigation was connected to the public spat between Lowe and Farage. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: On Thursday 6 March we received an allegation of verbal threats made by a 67-year-old man on Friday 13 December 2024. Officers are carrying out an assessment of the allegations to determine what further action may be required. In its statement, the party said it had appointed a KC, a senior lawyer, to investigate the allegations of bullying in Lowes offices, adding it understood complaints had been made to parliamentary authorities. To date, Mr Lowe has yet to cooperate with this investigation, the statement added. In addition to these allegations of a disturbing pattern of behaviour, Mr Lowe has on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence against our party chairman. Accordingly, this matter is with the police. Writing on X after Reform UKs statement, Lowe said he had cooperated and spoken at length with the lawyer appointed by the party. Tim Montgomerie, a former Conservative commentator who defected to Reform last December, said ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge5jl62nro,2025-03-08
Starmer welcomes EU moves to boost defence spending,"Sir Keir Starmer has welcomed an EU move to increase defence spending that was decided at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday. The package includes loans and weakened deficit rules in a bid to boost the continents military forces. Speaking after a call with EU leaders earlier, the prime minister said the historic move was another sign of Europe stepping up. It comes as Sir Keir tries to persuade European countries to join a coalition of the willing to deter Russia in the event of a peace deal in Ukraine. According to UK officials, about 20 countries are interested in joining the coalition, although would not necessarily offer to send troops, but instead provide other support. In recent weeks, EU leaders have repeated longstanding promises to boost Europes military capabilities, after voicing concerns the continent cannot rely on US security support under President Trump. At a summit in Brussels on Thursday, they backed plans to jointly borrow 150bn to lend to EU governments for military expenditure. The European Commission has also proposed diverting regional development funds towards defence, alongside an emergency suspension of the blocs rules on government debt and deficit levels. Starmer was briefed on the plans in a call earlier with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, alongside the leaders of Canada, Turkey, Norway and Iceland. Afterwards Downing Street said the prime minister applauded the progress made at the Brussels meeting. He also discussed plans for the coalition of the willing and noted a meeting in Paris next week would be an important moment to drive forward planning, a No 10 spokeswoman added. The UK and France have said they are willing to provide peacekeeping troops to Ukraine and are urging other European countries to make the same commitment. But Sir Keir has said that in order to be effective, their presence in Ukraine must be backed by security guarantees from the US. US President Donald Trump has so far avoided committing to such support, instead arguing that the presence of American workers in Ukraine as part of a potential minerals deal, would be sufficient to deter Russia from further invading Ukraine. Russia has flatly rejected such a move saying it would amount to direct, official and unveiled involvement of Nato members in the war against Russia. Talks between the US and Ukraine aimed at reaching an agreement will take place next week in Saudi Arabia. Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Friday he was strongly considering new sanctions and tariffs on Russia, following a wave of overnight strikes on Ukraine. Writing on social media, he added: To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!! UK Defence Secretary John Healey earlier returned from Washington DC, where he met with his US counterpart Pete Hegseth to discuss ending Russias war on Ukraine. Speaking in Washington, Healey said: Its a lasting, secure peace th...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wpy9x890wo,2025-03-08
Former Liverpool mayor charged with bribery,"Former Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson and city politician Derek Hatton have been charged with bribery and misconduct relating to council contracts, along with 10 others, police have said. The charges come after a Merseyside Police probe, Operation Aloft, focused on a number of property developers. Mr Anderson and Mr Hatton were first arrested in 2020 as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts. Posting on X, the former mayor urged people against falling into the trap of saying no smoke without fire. He added: I am innocent of charges and will fight to clear my name. Thank you for all the messages of support and best wishes. Father-of-four Mr Anderson was elected in 2012, having been a Labour councillor since 1998. Merseyside Police said 12 individuals had been charged following an investigation connected to the awarding of commercial and business contracts from Liverpool City Council between 2010 and 2020. Liverpool City Council said it had supported the police investigation and would continue to cooperate as required. A spokesperson added: It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage. Those charged are: They will all appear at Preston Magistrates Court on 28 March. Robin Weyell, deputy chief crown prosecutor said: The Crown Prosecution Service has reviewed a full file of evidence from Merseyside Police and has authorised the investigation team to charge 12 people with 12 offences related to bribery and misconduct in public office. He said criminal proceedings were now active and it was extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.

Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down,"A bill that had suggested banning smartphones in schools and addictive algorithms aimed at young teenagers has been watered down to gain government support. Labour MP Josh MacAlister, who brought the private members bill, told MPs during a parliamentary debate on Friday that reducing smartphone use in law would be a process, not one big bang event. The proposed legislation calls for the government to say within a year whether it will raise the digital age of consent from 13 to 16 - meaning companies could not receive childrens data without parental permission until that age. Data Protection and Telecoms Minister Chris Bryant said the bills recommendations very much chime with what we intend to do. The bill also says parents need further guidance on smartphone use by children and urges the government to come up with a plan for research into the impact of use of social media on children within 12 months. Bryant said his department had asked the University of Cambridge to run a feasibility study into the impact of smartphones and social media - and that it would work to roughly the same timetable as the bill was calling for. He added that measures from the Online Safety Act due to be implemented in the coming months, would help protect children online. The act puts a duty on social media companies to protect children from harmful content. Bryant concluded his speech by telling MPs inaction is not an option for the government, adding that it was not the end of the matter. The debate on the bill was adjourned until 11 July. Private members bills rarely make it into law without government backing, but they are an opportunity for backbenchers to raise an issues profile. When the legislation was initially proposed in October, it outlined plans to give head teachers legal backing to make schools mobile free, and strengthen Ofcoms powers to prevent children being exposed to apps and services addictive by design. In Fridays debate, Conservative Kit Malthouse, a former education secretary, told the House of Commons the watering down amounted to the gutting of what could have been a landmark bill. He said parents were screaming for help from lawmakers, and that this government, like the last, has dithered, diluted and capitulated on the issue. When asked about the changes, MacAlister, a former teacher, said he had been working really closely with the government to put forward practical measures, and was optimistic ministers would support it. Responding to criticism of the bills watering down in Parliament, MacAlister said it was important that MPs made progress on the issue at every possible opportunity. There have been growing calls to restrict childrens smartphone use, including local schools combining to revise their phone policies and parent groups joining forces to delay giving their child a smartphone. However, some of those in favour of smartphones say they provide opportunities for child development, including socialising, and there is little evidence...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8y7dvw9ddo,2025-03-08
Minister threatens law change after 'two-tier' row,"Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has told the Sentencing Council she will review its powers and legislate, if necessary, following a row over its new guidance on sending people to jail. The changes, which are due to come into force in England and Wales next month, would make the ethnicity or faith of an offender a bigger factor when deciding whether to jail them. Ministers do not have the power to overturn the guidance, but in a letter Mahmood urged the councils chairman to reconsider as soon as possible. Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the new rules were anti-white and anti-Christian and amounted to two-tier justice. In a post on social media, he said that if the government did not act he would challenge the rules in court. The Sentencing Council said the guidance would ensure courts had the most comprehensive information available to hand out an appropriate sentence and could address disadvantages faced within the criminal justice system. Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences. The analysis produced by the Ministry of Justice said the difference could be attributed to a range of factors including the varying offence mix across ethnic groups. It added that lower average custodial sentences for white defendants may be a result of a higher percentage of guilty plea rates for this ethnic group, resulting in shorter custodial sentences. Writing to Lord Justice William Davis, chairman of the Sentencing Council, Mahmood said she wanted to make clear my displeasure at the changes. As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law, she wrote. She said she would be considering whether policy decisions of such import should be made by the Sentencing Council. A review of the councils role and powers will now take place alongside the existing review into sentencing being led by former Tory minister David Gauke. Mahmood concluded her letter by warning the council that following the review she would legislate if necessary. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - who previously sat on the Sentencing Council when he was director of public prosecutions - said he was concerned by the guidance. The new sentencing guidance puts a greater emphasis on the need for pre-sentence reports for judges. Pre-sentence reports give judges details on the offenders background, motives and personal life before sentencing - then recommend a punishment and what would work best for rehabilitation. But over recent years their use has decreased. Magistrates and judges will be advised to get a pre-sentence report before handing out punishment for someone of an ethnic or faith minority - alongside other groups such as young adults, abuse survivors and pregnant women. These factors are not an exhaustive list, the council said. A pre-sentence report can still be necessary if an individual does not f...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984l6pn30zo,2025-03-08
Ex-Tory minister claims Drakeford dented Covid trust,"Mark Drakeford dented peoples confidence in the UK government during the pandemic, the Welsh secretary at the time has said. Simon Hart said it was exactly what you dont want in a national crisis, telling the BBC Walescast podcast of his frustration with the then Labour first minister. Drakeford was selecting all the things that worked and claiming them as Welsh government, and then being very public about the things that didnt work, and saying that they were UK government, said the ex-Conservative MP. The Welsh government said: All decisions by Welsh ministers related to Covid-19 were based on evidence and always made in the best interests of Wales. The former Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP has published diaries on his time in the UK cabinet, first as secretary of state for Wales under Boris Johnson and then as Rishi Sunaks chief whip, enforcing party discipline. In Ungovernable: The Political Diaries of a Chief Whip Hart makes clear his frustration at the relationship between the two governments, particularly during the Covid -19 pandemic. He also comments on Mr Drakefords appearance at a Remembrance Day event, calling him a scruffy old university lecturer with dirty shoes. Hart told Walescast Drakeford was a very nice man, but hed never made any secret of the fact he was no massive fan of devolution. He said he felt Drakeford helped to create a false impression that nice Mr Drakeford - and he is a very nice man - had all the solutions, and nasty Mr Johnson caused all of the problems. I thought that was a very lazy politicisation of a very serious situation and I thought Mark Drakeford was party to that, said Hart. It wasnt necessarily about political advantage. The consequence, said Hart, was messaging to the public that was not as clear as it might have been to minimise the risk of the pandemic causing even more mayhem. Hart said he wrote the book to ask the question what went wrong? between December 2019 and July 2024, when the Conservatives went from an 80-seat majority to a general election drubbing. In a separate interview with BBC Politics Wales, to be broadcast on Sunday, he said we have to ask ourselves the question, how on earth did this happen? That is a spectacular fall from grace and, unless were prepared to look in the mirror and say ok lets be serious about what we did well and what we did badly, we will continue to make those mistakes. I dont think it makes particularly comfortable reading at times, he told Walescast. Things went from comedy to tragedy very quickly, as I went from being patient and well-meaning to irritable and disillusioned at times, if I was honest, he added. He stopped short of saying the Conservative Party was ungovernable, characterising his account as more of a description of politics more generally. Keir Starmer suddenly found he was hitting exactly the same headwinds as wed hit fairly early on in his tenure, said Hart. Big majority, new government, all of that - yet it was still difficult.

Tory peer apologises for Holocaust memorial comment,"Conservative peer Lord Hamilton has apologised after saying the Jewish community should pay for their own Holocaust memorial because they have an awful lot of money. The former minister said his comments in a House of Lords debate on plans for a memorial near Parliament were insensitive but not intended to be antisemitic. A Conservative Party spokesman condemned the comments as completely unacceptable and flagrantly antisemitic. Responding to calls for him to be suspended from the parliamentary party, leader Kemi Badenoch said: I have intervened in the situation. Lord Hamilton misspoke and hes apologised and I think that should be the end of the matter. Speaking during a debate on legislation to allow a Holocaust memorial and learning centre to be built in Westminster, with public funds used to pay for it, Lord Hamilton said: I do not understand why the government have volunteered taxpayers money, when there is so little of it, to finance this. The Jewish community in Britain has an awful lot of money. It has a lot of education charities that would contribute towards this. I do not understand why they should not pay for their own memorial. Challenged by Lord Austin that the memorial was for everybody not just the Jewish community, Lord Hamilton added: I take that point, but the driving forces behind putting up this memorial are the Jewish people in this country. They are people who have property everywhere. I do not see why they should not fund it. The former minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major withdrew his comments the following day and said in a statement: My remarks were not intended to be antisemitic and I apologise unreservedly. With retrospect having read my comments, I realise that my remarks were insensitive and I apologise. I intend to meet with groups from the Jewish community in order to better understand how to communicate about issues affecting British Jews. His original remarks were criticised by the Antisemitism Policy Trust, who said they were ill-judged, racist and false. During the debate, Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein said: The Holocaust is not something that is just about the Jews. He added that Lord Hamiltons comments were probably a pretty eloquent contribution as to why we need this memorial - and near Parliament. Former Labour MP and crossbench peer Lord Austin described the remarks as disgusting racism and called on the Conservative Party to take proper action. The Tories were quick to demand Labour took action on antisemitism and quite right too, he wrote on social media. But they must now do the same themselves. Plans for a Holocaust memorial in Victoria Tower Gardens in Westminster were first announced under Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron in 2016. A bill to remove restrictions on the memorial being built in the gardens and to allow public funds to be used for it is currently making its way through Parliament.

Labour MPs urge investors to support defence firms,"More than 100 Labour MPs and peers have urged banks and investment firms to relax their rules on investing in defence companies. In an open letter, first reported by the Financial Times, they said ill considered ethical investment rules had been holding back their access to finance. They wrote that a change in approach would help the UK bolster its defences, and contribute to the governments drive to boost economic growth. It also reflects a trend in recent years to emphasise the national security element of defence investment since Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Leading weapons companies have seen sales and their share price surge in recent years, as countries seek to rearm after years of declining defence spending. The UK is among those countries committing to ramp up spending, with Sir Keir Starmer announcing plans last week to increase defence spending from 2.3 to 2.5 of national income by 2027, funded by cuts to overseas aid. However in their letter, the politicians argued that environmental, social and governance (ESG) rules adopted by some banks and fund managers are continuing to impact the sectors access to finance. They said ESG rules, which can prevent investment in oil, tobacco and other sectors deemed unethical, had generally driven positive change in the economy. But they added that financial institutions should rethink ESG mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment. The letter was co-ordinated by the Labour Growth Group, a group of MPs formed last year in part to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects. Some investment funds have adopted specific rules against investing in weapons manufacturers and others have broader rules obliging them to consider the risk that investment could lead to human rights breaches. But some analysts have pointed out that attitudes on the ethics of investing in the sector appear to have shifted in recent years, with the share of ESG funds holding shares in defence and aerospace firms on the up compared to 2022. The previous Conservative government had also sought to encourage defence investment, with former prime minister Rishi Sunak arguing there is nothing more ethical than defending our way of life. The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, signed a statement last year stating that investment in good, high-quality, well-run defence companies was compatible with ESG considerations. In their letter, the MPs and peers also argued that defence firms faced unnecessary barriers to doing business in the UK, echoing longstanding complaints from the sector about access to finance. ADS, the industry lobby group, has previously argued that defence firms face higher regulatory barriers when it comes to securing bank accounts and loans. These include rules obliging banks to run enhanced money laundering checks for defence and security companies, and to make sure they are not financing weapons banned under international treaties.

Police unit dubbed 'authoritarian censor',"A national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the publics right to know. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found. Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team  known as the central referral unit (CRU)  was acting like an authoritarian censor rather than a public body. The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The BBC was alerted to the units involvement in local forces FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids. Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UKs total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the units request. The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers. Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time. On another occasion, it cited concerns about negative press when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates. The software has been banned by Scotland Yard. Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body. It is alarming that the NPCC is going beyond giving advice to individual forces and instead seemingly orchestrating how every force responds to sensitive transparency requests, he said. The CRU said it was legitimately discussing negative press or media attention when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure. It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020. FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure. Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret. The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies. Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called applicant-blind principle when responding to FOI requests. The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the a...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0ypn4pyyro,2025-03-08
Bid to slice Melton Mowbray pork pie zone refused,"An application to shrink the geographical area where Melton Mowbray pork pies can be produced has been rejected. The pies have special protected geographical status, which means only producers using the traditional recipe and in the vicinity of the Melton Mowbray can use the Leicestershire towns name. The pastry can be produced in the town of Melton Mowbray and its surrounding region, including Nottingham to the north and Northampton to the south, but The Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (MMPPA) applied for this area to be reduced. However, the request was refused by the Department for Environment, Food  Rural Affairs (Defra) in decision notice published on Wednesday. The pies status is called Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). Matthew OCallaghan, chairman of the MMPPA, said when the group originally applied for the protection - awarded in 2008 - they had historical evidence as to where the boundaries should go. He said: In the south, the boundary was originally the road between Leicester and Stamford. But Defra suggested it be extended because a company in Wellingborough, which had been making the pork pies for decades, objected as it would have been outside the area, Mr OCallaghan said. Mr OCallaghan added: We agreed the area would be almost doubled so as to go down to the south to include this producer in Wellingborough. However, he said the producer - Saxbys - had closed and no pork pies had been made in that area for at least 10 years. Mr OCallaghan said the association therefore thought it was reasonable to ask Defra to amend the region to the original proposal. It would not have affected anybody currently producing Melton Mowbray pork pies, he added. He said the association was disappointed the application was rejected because we think what people want when they buy a Melton Mowbray pork pie is a pie tied to a historic area. Explaining the area they wanted the protection reduced to, he said it was between the Leicester to Stamford road - the A47 to the south, the Great North Road the A1 to the east, the River Trent in the north, including Nottingham, and then to the west, the River Soar. Defras notice rejecting the application said: The proposed amendment would reduce the geographical production area and exclude certain producers from using the PGI designation. This would directly affect market access and impose new trade restrictions, which is not permitted under the regulation. It added: The applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the quality, reputation, or characteristics of the product are now exclusive to the proposed smaller area. The association has been advised if it opts to appeal against the decision, the deadline is 2 April. Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The MP who was shot in the foot as a teen,"It was two days before his 18th birthday in 1994 when Stuart Anderson was shot. He was taking part in a live fire training exercise on the Brecon Beacons when he heard a gun fire close by. His friend screamed and Stuart thought somebody else had been injured. Rifleman Anderson rushed to give his comrade first aid but quickly realised that he could not move his left leg, which now felt warm. That was the moment when he realised that he had been shot in the foot. This report contains images of severe injury There was no way of getting me down from the mountains and I was left there for hours without pain relief, he said. They got me to hospital in Abergavenny and a surgeon told me that Id probably have to have my foot amputated. I did what every hardened rifleman did, which was cry and ask for my mum, he said with a smile. A specialist surgeon managed to save his foot and all five toes over four separate operations, but the injury was too complex to ever fully recover from. His gunshot wound was caused by a fault in the assault rifle, which the British Army used at the time. Another soldiers SA80 had overheated in training and fired by mistake, an error which is known as cooking off. Despite having to learn to walk again, the 48-year-old, went on to serve in various campaigns, including Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo. He retired from the Royal Green Jackets, now known as The Rifles, eight years after joining the army and went into the security and defence industry. Then in 2019 he was elected the Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West, and last year he became the new MP for South Shropshire. But the pain in his foot would not go away. I was told after my surgery that I would never walk without a walking stick but I was determined to live a full and active life. Ten years after I left the military I had to pay to have shrapnel taken out of my foot. Ive pushed myself to the extreme in multiple sports, but it away hurts. He said he received no support from the Army after he left, despite having 10 operations over the last 31 years. In January, he had his most recent surgery through the NHS to reconstruct his foot, but weeks later he had to have a follow up operation to remove two toes. I probably should have had the surgery 18 months ago but I was a whip in government during historic times and I didnt have the capacity to step back from that, he said. If the latest procedure has not been a success then he may have to have another operation to have more of his foot removed. The MP is using his experience to highlight the suffering and lengthy recovery that many veterans face when leaving the armed forces with injuries. Im a member of Parliament facing this, so I can use my position for good and raise awareness of some of the dreadful things that Shropshire veterans have been through, he said. Improvements have happened over the years but we are nowhere near where we need to go.

HMP Highpoint set to become 'UK's largest jail',"A rural prison is to increase its capacity by more than 50 to become the UKs largest jail, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said. Three four-storey houseblocks will be built at HMP Highpoint in Suffolk, between the villages of Stradishall and Great Thurlow, near Haverhill. Construction work has begun on the 700-place expansion, including workshops and teaching facilities to help prisoners get jobs on release, said the MoJ. Minister for Prisons, Lord Timpson, said they were designed with a laser-focus on cutting crime and were part of plans to deliver 14,000 more prison spaces by 2031. We cannot simply build our way out of this crisis, which is why were also reviewing sentencing so we can lock up dangerous offenders, cut crime and make our streets safer, Lord Timpson added. Highpoint currently holds just under 1,300 prisoners. The MoJ said that on completion, Highpoint will be the largest prison in terms of land size in North-West Europe and the largest in the UK based on prisoner population. Prison governor Nigel Smith said: The new accommodation will provide a safe and secure environment for us to rehabilitate prisoners and get them ready for release. The expansion is part of the governments 2.3bn 10-year prison capacity strategy. The government released certain offenders early last year to ease overcrowding in prisons. In January 2024, HM Inspectorate of Prisons said Highpoint was failing to deliver its core purpose to prepare men for their return to the community. Since August 2022, it has worked with City and Guilds, which offers vocational education and apprenticeship partnerships, to teach inmates how to maintain railway infrastructure. Building and property maintenance company Wates Group has been contracted to deliver the new accommodation and workshop blocks. The MoJ said it would create hundreds of jobs during its construction and more than 200 jobs once it is built.

UK and Ireland have 'turned a page on the turbulent years',"The UK and Ireland have turned a page on the turbulent years in their relationship and are set on a meaningful partnership, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said. He was speaking alongside the Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin as part of a UK-Ireland summit in Liverpool. Sir Keir said the event marked a new era between the two governments, which was the right thing to do...given the global situation. While the taoiseach said he appreciated the prime ministers proactivity in resetting relations with the Irish government, after years of difficulties with the Conservatives during Brexit negotiations. The summit is the first of its kind and comes amid the backdrop of growing security concerns among the UK and EU countries about the influence of Russia. The business roundtable on Thursday morning included industry leaders and businesses across tech, finance, clean energy, manufacturing and construction from the UK and Ireland. The discussion focused on potential opportunities for growth and investment, and how the UK and Ireland can work together to build an even more resilient and successful trading relationship. They also discussed how both countries can work closer together on renewable energy, tech, AI and security. The two leaders have announced a new data sharing arrangement aimed at increasing the production offshore energy. As part of the summit, Ireland also announced new investments into the UK worth 185.5 million, which the UK government say could create more than 2,500 jobs across the country. On Wednesday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the UK-Ireland summit marked a major and significant manifestation of a reset in relations between the two governments in the post-Brexit era. He also paid tribute to the prime minister for his leadership over the last while.

The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it would introduce fluoridation to more areas of north-east England. The plans had been out for public consultation last year. The DHSC said it hoped the move would cut the number of children admitted to hospital for tooth decay operations. The British Dental Association (BDA) said it welcomed the move. Dr Lucy OMalley at the University of Manchester said the scheme would likely benefit children but there was no evidence water fluoridation reduced oral health inequalities. This meant other measures needed to be put in place as well, she said. Alongside its plans to increase water fluoridation in the North East, DHSC also announced a major nationwide supervised toothbrushing scheme. Prof Anne-Marie Glenny, also from the University of Manchester, said the widespread availability of fluoride toothpaste made the impact of fluoridating water less significant. While this effect is less than in the past and may not be felt on an individual level, this still may represent an important population level effect, she said. She said fluoridating water supplies should be considered against costs and potential harms, and fluoride levels should be actively monitored. Northumbrian Water has been supplying artificially fluoridated water since the late 1960s to Chester-le-Street, Consett, and Stanley in County Durham, Alnwick, Hexham and Cramlington in Northumberland and parts of North Tyneside, Newcastle and Gateshead. DHSC will now expand the scheme to Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, South Tyneside, Stockton, Sunderland and areas not currently covered in Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside. The body said about one in 10 people in England currently had fluoride added to their water supplies. It did not say when this new North East expansion would occur. The government previously said for every 1 spent on water fluoridation in the area, it expected to save 13 after five years. The BDA said the scheme would provide a very strong return on investment and the government needed to double down to safeguard dental health. This included mandatory action on the marketing, labelling and reformulation of sugary food and drink, it said.

NZ fires envoy to UK who questioned Trump's grasp of history,"New Zealand has fired its most senior envoy to the United Kingdom over remarks that questioned US President Donald Trumps grasp of history. At an event in London on Tuesday, High Commissioner Phil Goff compared efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine to the 1938 Munich Agreement, which allowed Adolf Hitler to annex part of Czechoslovakia. Mr Goff recalled how Sir Winston Churchill had criticised the agreement, then said of the US leader: President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history? His comments were deeply disappointing and made his position untenable, New Zealands Foreign Minister Winston Peters said. His comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. He contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germanys threats. Mr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war. Peters said Mr Goffs views did not represent those of the New Zealand government. When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, youre not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand, local media reported Peters saying. Its not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically, he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about. Mr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealands largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence. Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon. When it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: I know hes the prime minister, I made him the prime minister. The 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxons National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government. Luxon, for his part, said Peters decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was entirely appropriate. Former Prime Minister Helen Clark was among those who criticised Mr Goffs sacking, saying it was backed by a very thin excuse. I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 and US actions now, she wrote in a post on X.

"US 'destroying' world order, Ukraine's ambassador to UK says","The US is destroying the established world order, Ukraines ambassador to the UK has claimed. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said the White House had questioned the unity of the Western world and was taking more and more steps towards Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The comments come as the US puts pressure on Ukraine to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, and after a public clash between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump. Zelensky has since said he is ready to work under Trumps strong leadership, an apparent cooling in tensions welcomed by Trump - and which comes after the US paused military aid to Kyiv. But Mr Zaluzhnyis remarks at a conference at Chatham House in London on Thursday suggest there remains discontent over the USs actions. He told an audience: We see that it is not only Russia and the axis of evil trying to destroy the world order, but the US is actually destroying it completely. The Ukrainian envoy added that talks between the US and Russia - the latter of which was headed by a war criminal in President Vladimir Putin - showed the White House was making steps towards the Kremlin regime, fully realising that in this case Europe could be a new target for Russia. Mr Zaluzhnyi, who took over as Kyivs ambassador to London in 2024 following three years as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, also suggested that Nato could cease to exist as a result of Washingtons change in posture. While Zelensky has expressed a wish to bring the war in Ukraine to an end swiftly, Kyiv has voiced concerns about the Trump administrations handling of talks and the concessions to Moscow that may be made without firm security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump vowed during the US election campaign to bring the war to an end quickly, and preliminary US-Russian talks were held in Saudi Arabia last month - without European or Ukrainian representatives present. The USs decision to halt its military assistance to Ukraine and intelligence sharing has been cast by Trump administration officials as a means of getting Kyiv to co-operate with the US-led peace talks. Any corresponding pressure the US has been putting on Moscow to make concessions has not been made public. Zaluzhnyi said the pause in intelligence sharing, as well as an earlier decision to oppose a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, were a huge challenge for the entire world. His comments come as Politico reports that members of Trumps team held discussions with some of Zelenskys political opponents, after Trump allies suggested the Ukrainian president should stand aside as his term expired in May. Citing unnamed sources in the US and Ukraine, it says talks were held with opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and senior members of Petro Poroshenkos party, who preceded Zelensky as president. Independent opinion polls in Ukraine suggest Zaluzhnyi has the most public support with at least 70, Zelensky has 57 suppor...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq9n48el43o,2025-03-08
"Emergency powers being abused to dig up roads, MPs told","Utilities companies are abusing their emergency powers to dig up streets in England, causing major disruption for drivers and public transport, MPs have been told. Emergency powers allow works to be carried out with little or no notice in certain circumstances such as gas leaks or a burst water pipe. Giving evidence to Transport Committee, Keith McNally, from the Confederation of Passenger Transport which represents bus operators, said his members felt these powers were sometimes being used for non-emergencies. However, Clive Bairsto from Streetworks UK, the trade association for utilities companies, said there was no evidence of abuse of powers. MPs on the Transport Committee are conducting an inquiry into street works - the work carried out by utilities companies to install, repair or maintain services such as broadband or water. Jack Cousens, head of roads policy at the AA, told MPs that the average number of holes being dug by utility firms in England outside of London had jumped from 13,250 per local authority in 2018 to more than 17,200 last year. He said improving broadband and rolling out charge points for electric vehicles were contributing factors but added there is also more evidence of just general works going on from utilities companies. McNally said a surge in roadworks was making route planning and timetabling increasingly difficult - pointing out that during the day some bus services have to repeatedly loop past the same excavations causing further and further delays. He added that unlike other road users, buses can not simply divert down routes of their drivers choosing because passengers need to be collected at specific points. Asked whether the emergency permit to open up roads was being abused, McNally said he believed it was. The number of works undertaken on an emergency basis seems to have increased. Im not sure about the overall volume but our members are saying to us that a very high proportion seem to be on an emergency basis. Cousens questioned why more works by different companies could not be done at the same time to prevent repeat disruption to roads. The gas company seems to be in one week, they go away, then the water company get in the hole, then they disappear. Then the broadband company get in the hole and they fill it back up and they disappear and somebody else comes in. And we have this horrible cycle of roadworks that never seem to end that then create lots of other problems with the road surface with potholes ruining the structural integrity of our roads. The Transport Committee was told there are over 200 different organisations which have rights to open up the road surface. Bairsto said it was normal practice to try and co-ordinate works - with some local authorities even having champions to do just that. In a debate at the beginning of the year, Transport Minister Lillian Greenwood said her department had examined Street Manager data and spoken to industry representatives and found no evidence of misuse.",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr29xn4rlpo,2025-03-08
Reform would scrap 'net stupid zero' policies - Tice,"The deputy leader of Reform UK has said his party would scrap net stupid zero policies during a visit to Scotland. Richard Tice said eco-policies such as targets to achieve net zero were destroying jobs in the oil and gas sector. The politician is in Scotland to announce a further two councillors have defected to join his party. He said Reform UK was growing in popularity because their policies will make people better off. Speaking on the BBC Radios Good Morning Scotland programme, Tice said the party was picking up support due to its common sense approach. He said: The reason we are going up in the polls is because our policies are the policies that will make people better off. For example scrapping net stupid zero that is destroying tens and tens of thousands of great, highly skilled, well-paid Scottish jobs in the oil and gas industry, in the chemicals industry. He added: We are the new kids on the block, weve got some bold policies that can turn around the Scottish economy. He said Scotland would benefit most of all from scrapping green targets, which he claimed were so destructive to jobs and skills. The deputy leader previously argued net-zero policies were to blame for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK. In February, he announced that Reform UK plans to tax solar farms, and pass new laws to put energy cables underground rather than on pylons. Despite scrapping certain climate change targets last year, the Scottish government still aims to achieve net zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by 2045. This is five years ahead of the UKs target of 2050. Tice was speaking during a visit to Scotland to announce two more councillors have defected to his party from the Scottish Conservative party. They are John Gray from Renfrewshire Council and Ross Lambie from South Lanarkshire Council. He said he was very proud of the councillors who are joining the party from the now frankly irrelevant Conservative party. But when pushed to name his partys new members and which councils they served on, Mr Tice repeated their first names John and Ross. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said the party is focussed on reaching out to voters who are disillusioned with all parties and all politicians. Five former Scottish Conservative councillors have already defected to Reform - one in Glasgow, two in Aberdeenshire and two in North Ayrshire. Tice, the MP for Boston and Skegness, said: Were going up in the polls, I think youre going to see us by the summer around 20. He also claimed that Reform almost have more members in Scotland than the Labour Party. In 2021, Labour had about 16,000 members in Scotland. Reform says their current membership in Scotland is about 9,300. Tice said: I think thats the reason why John Swinney and the Labour Party, Anas Sarwar, are terrified. Tice added they intend to field candidates in every seat during next years Scottish parliament elections, campaigning with Scotland specific policies, in an attempt to secure th...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k75qp1edo,2025-03-08
"Councils fear shake-up won't improve finances, survey says","A large portion of council leaders fear a major shake-up of local government will not solve the financial pressures their authorities are facing, a survey has suggested. Ministers are streamlining local government by merging councils and setting up single authorities that provide all the services in their areas. But a survey by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU) think tank suggested there was low support for it among council leaders, with less than a quarter of those who responded believing the changes would ease their financial challenges. A government spokesperson said reorganisation was a tough choice but the right one to improve the sustainability and resilience of local authorities. Councils have been under financial pressure for some time. A recent report by the National Audit Office found funding had failed to keep pace with growing demand for services - particularly social care, support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, and temporary accommodation. The government has increased the amount of money available to councils, and has promised to reform the way their funding works. The government says the reorganisation will streamline and simplify services, make savings and create structures that will allow more powers to be handed down to council leaders and mayors. But in some areas the plans have proved controversial. A survey of council leaders and senior officials, carried out by the LGIU, found many thought the plans were unclear, the timescales were not achievable and while the plans might produce long-term savings, they would add to pressure on councils in the short-term. Only 23 of those surveyed agreed with the statement that the reorganisation would alleviate the financial challenges facing councils. The survey received responses from 150 councils out of 317 in England. The think tanks chief executive, Jonathan Carr-West, said: On the one hand, the government has had some success in resetting the central-local relationship and there is near consensus that the promised multi-year settlements will benefit council finances. Conversely, many councils are anticipating that reorganisation and the increase in National Insurance Contributions will heap added pressure onto already overextended council budgets. The LGIU said the problems were not insurmountable, calling for councils to be more involved and more manageable timescales. The restructuring of local councils started in some places under the last Conservative government, with Labour planning to extend it across all of England. It would mean areas with two-tiers of councils, both county and district, would be replaced with single unitary councils that provide all services, with more regional mayors. Last month the government agreed to delay local elections that were due to take place in May in nine council areas to allow them to reorganise. For some, its a welcome move that will make help councils deliver services more effectively. Tim Oliver, chai...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3yl3ppe95o,2025-03-08
Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed,"Ministers, facing potential cuts of billions of pounds from the welfare budget, have announced plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work. The coaches are already employed by job centres but will be redeployed to focus on tackling economic inactivity, said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). It said the staff would provide personalised and intensive support to thousands of sick and disabled people. But the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on people on low incomes, said only a tiny percentage would actually find a job. The coaches will offer tailored employment support to people on health-related benefits and help them access support with writing CVs and interview techniques, the government said. Ministers hope moving thousands of people into jobs will help them unlock the benefits of work and cut the rapidly rising cost of health and disability benefits. But the Resolution Foundation said only about 3 of the hundreds of thousands of people likely to lose benefit payments were likely to find a job. In a report called Delivering the Undeliverable, the researchers argue the causes of the rising welfare costs include the country getting older and sicker and that while ministers are keen on quick financial cuts, truly effective reforms will take time to deliver. The government described the 1,000 redeployed work coaches as a downpayment on plans to overhaul employment support, set to be unveiled within weeks. The current system fails to intervene early enough to stop people becoming unemployed and misses opportunities to support their return, the DWP said. It has become defined by poor experiences and low trust among many people who use it, it added. Some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness, the department said. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase on the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the broken welfare system Labour had inherited was failing sick and disabled people, is bad for the taxpayer, and holding the economy back. For too long, sick, and disabled people have been told they cant work, denied support, and locked out of jobs, with all the benefits that good work brings, she said. But many sick and disabled people want and can work, with the right support. Selected figures published from a survey for the government suggest 44 of disabled people and those with a health condition in the UK do not trust the DWP to help people reach their full career potential. The same proportion believe DWP does not provide enough support to those out of work because of disability, ill health or a long-term health condition, according to the survey.

Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions,"The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the governments official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellors financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said the world has changed since Rachel Reevess Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had 9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. The OBRs forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK. The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its major measures -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellors self-imposed rules on borrowing money. The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending. Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are non-negotiable. The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March. The Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes, a government insider told the BBC. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellors response later this month. Insiders expect politically painful new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4s Today programme there had been a huge rise in the welfare budget and there were too many young people not in work, education or training. Theres a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and theres a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable, she added. Reeves has previously pledged fundamental reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election.

Ex-ambassadors warn of sharing intelligence with US,"Four former British ambassadors to the United States have expressed concern about the future of intelligence sharing with the US following the re-election of Donald Trump. Sir David Manning, who served as ambassador between 2003 and 2007, told a parliamentary committee some of Trumps appointees had strange track records which would create a problem on the intelligence front. Dame Karen Pierce, who only left the role last month, said intelligence sharing would continue even if at the top level there might be things we might wish to be circumspect about. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, ambassador from 2007 to 2012, said the relationship would be trickier to handle than probably at any other time. He said some of the people appointed by Trump to lead intelligence and security could present some difficulties in terms of their view of us and views of co-operation. He did not specify who he was referring to, however concern has been raised about the US presidents pick to be his director of national intelligence. Tulsi Gabbard has previously echoed Russias justification for invading Ukraine and her appointment to the role was welcomed by Russian state media. Earlier this year Lewis Lukens, a retired American diplomat, told the BBC that Gabbards dubious judgement could give allies reason to question how safe it is to share intelligence with the US. During her confirmation hearing with US senators, Gabbard dismissed suggestions she was Putins puppet as lies and smears. The ambassadors warnings came during an evidence session with the House of Lords International Relations and Defence Committee which heard from four former British diplomats to the US. Sir David told peers that if the UK wanted to be the go-to ally for the United States it had to have something to offer. He said the UKs military resources were stretched and the defence card was not the ace it once was. Lord Soames said the UK was still very, very, very good at intelligence and security and asked if that would still play a role in the UK-US relationship. Sir David said the question of intelligence-sharing was going to be more difficult to approach. Clearly if you have some Trump supportees in these key jobs who have very strange track records and have said very strange things about Nato allies and the Nato alliance and you have people in the administration who seem to be looking for ways of appeasing Russia then you have a problem on the intelligence front. That is a big question mark against how the special relationship is sustained during the Trump administration. Dame Karen said the way the US and UK helped each other was unique adding: There is an interoperability that you dont find with any other ally. Asked if that would last under the Trump presidency, she replied: The intelligence part of the relationship is so valuable it will last  even if as David was explaining - at the top level there might be things we might wish to be a bit circumspect about.

PM pays tribute to British troops after Vance comments,"Sir Keir Starmer has paid tribute to British veterans who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, after US Vice-President JD Vance was accused of disrespecting UK troops. Without directly referring to Vances comments, Sir Keir opened Prime Ministers Questions by remembering those who died fighting for Britain alongside our allies. On Tuesday, Vance was criticised for saying a US stake in Ukraines economy was a better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasnt fought a war in 30 or 40 years. The UK and France have said they would be willing to put troops in Ukraine as part of a peace deal - although Vance later insisted he did not mention either country. The prime minister told the Commons: Tomorrow marks 13 years since six young British soldiers were on patrol in Afghanistan when their vehicle was struck by an explosive tragically killing them all. He added: These men fought and died for their country, our country. And across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 642 individuals died fighting for Britain alongside our allies, many more were wounded. We will never forget their bravery and their sacrifice, and I know the whole House will join me in remembering them and all those who serve our country. Challenged over whether the tribute was a direct response to Vances comments, the prime ministers official spokesman said: You can draw your own conclusions. It is not standard practice for the PM to mark the anniversaries of the deaths of soldiers. Vances comments were later raised by Liberal Democrat MP Richard Foord, who suggested the vice-president should have more respect for those who lost their lives. He asked Sir Keir whether he would remind the US government the UK supported the country in Iraq following the 911 attacks. In response, the PM said: He speaks for the whole House. We do remember the role we played historically with our allies and we particularly remember those that made the ultimate sacrifice in that duty for their country and for our allies and thats why its so important that we make that point today. Although Vance did not specify which country or countries he was referring to in his interview with Fox Newss Hannity programme, he later stressed that he did not mention the UK or France. In a social media post, he said: But lets be direct: there are many countries who are volunteering (privately or publicly) support who have neither the battlefield experience nor the military equipment to do anything meaningful. So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, although Sir Keir has previously said a number of countries have agreed to. Vances original comments drew criticism from opposition MPs in the UK, as well as the French armed forces minister.

UK government to end North Sea windfall tax in 2030,"The UK government has launched a consultation on plans to replace the windfall tax on the profits of energy companies when it comes to an end in 2030. The Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced in May 2022 after companies recorded skyrocketing profits due to a sharp rise in energy prices. It was increased in the most recent UK government budget last year and means oil and gas producers are paying a headline tax rate of 78. The consultation seeks views on a new tax which would be triggered either when energy prices or profits are exceptionally high. The department for energy security and net zero said it would work to develop a plan that would deliver a fair return for the nation during times of unusually high prices. And it pledged to consult on a new regime for the industry in the North Sea, confirming new licences for oil and gas fields would not be approved. That comes after the UK government admitted plans for the Rosebank oil field off Shetland had been approved unlawfully after the decision was challenged in court by environmental campaigners. The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, said: The North Sea will be at the heart of Britains energy future. For decades, its workers, businesses and communities have helped power our country and our world. Oil and gas production will continue to play an important role and, as the world embraces the drive to clean energy, the North Sea can power our plan for change and clean energy future in the decades ahead. Oil and gas companies had posted record profits after wholesale prices spiked amid Russias invasion of Ukraine. The EPL was introduced by the previous Conservative government, which set the rate at 25 and put it in place until 2025. It was later increased to 35 by then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt and would run until at least 2029. Current chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that had been extended until at least 2030 and increased again by 3 in October 2024. The latest rise prompted the US-based firm Apache to announce it would end its North Sea operations by 2029. The company described the financial impact as onerous, adding continuing to operate in the area would be uneconomic. The price per barrel of oil has since fallen significantly. Trade association Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) previously warned the tax increase would stifle investment in the sector. Its chief executive, David Whitehouse, welcomed the news. He said: Todays consultations, on both the critical role of the North Sea in the energy transition and how the taxation regime will respond to unusually high oil and gas prices, will help to begin to give certainty to investors and create a stable investment environment for years to come. Alongside oil and gas production, the government said it wanted to ensure the North Sea would become a world-leading example for offshore clean energy. It said it was committed to working with the sector, trade unions and other organisations on a phased transition for the oil and gas industry. However, energy min...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7vd32myeko,2025-03-08
"Stop the Boats slogan was too stark, Rishi Sunak tells BBC","There is one phrase, one slogan, one promise which is associated with former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak more than any other. It is Stop the Boats. Yet, in his first wide-ranging interview since leaving Downing Street, the former prime minister says he regrets ever saying it because it was too stark..too binary. And he concedes that it couldnt actually be delivered. This is just one of the lessons from Downing Street which the man who presided over the worst ever election defeat for the Conservative Party says hes learned, in a conversation lasting more than two hours for my Political Thinking podcast. It covers not only the mistakes he thinks he made, but also the disagreements about the right way to manage the economy that he had with Boris Johnson; the radical ideas he wishes he couldve implemented; the lessons he learned from being chancellor during the Covid pandemic - and his attitudes to race and faith and Englishness as the first British Asian prime minister. Sunak is in reflective mood talking about a job he was catapulted into, saying he didnt probably have the time to enjoy it in the moment or appreciate it in the moment because of the context in which I was doing it. That context was not just an economic crisis but a political one. The Tories were on their third leader in just 50 days, and thered been no election of party members or the wider public. I didnt have a mandate, he says, and defends his approach of trying to bring warring factions together. To do otherwise, he says, would have been a huge gamble because the thing just could have collapsed. And would that have been good for the country? I dont think so. I think what the country needed was stability. Hes not changed his mind about wanting to deport migrants who cross the channel to Rwanda, and says he now backs leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), if its not reformed. He says the court has taken on new powers. Theres been mission creep...It does need to reform or we should leave. When I asked him if he had taken his eye off the ball in regards to soaring levels of net migration, he concedes that although he took very strong action to bring the levels of legal migration downI should have done them sooner. Sunak was in many ways an accidental prime minister. It was October 2022, and he learned that Liz Truss had survived in the job for less time than that famous lettuce, whilst having a meal with his two daughters at TGIs in Teesside after a game of bowling. Four days later, he walked into Number 10 as her successor. He says he had very mixed feelingsgiven what had happened but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves doing your duty. Youve just got to focus on doing your best, doing what youre there to do, and not worry about the rest, he says. It was a very helpful concept for meI kept coming back to that.

More funding for judges to tackle record court delays,"Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales. The Ministry of Justices announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed. Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm. The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts. There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood. Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028. The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails. Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court. She said a cap on sitting days had a drastic effect, with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog. A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was unprecedented, but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem. The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise, she told the Today programme. We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts, she added. But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting. Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt out of reach for many victims, which was causing extra trauma. One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back. Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4 to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under immense pressure because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever. With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support, she said. I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first. Separately, Parliaments Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had accepted cou...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn89656e01do,2025-03-08
Chris Mason: Starmer finds subtle way to deal with Team Trump,"Week after week, there used to be a grim but poignant ritual at the start of Prime Ministers Question Time. The prime minister of the day would begin by acknowledging by name and by rank the British servicemen and women killed serving their country. But what happened this week was different. Not different in how it was done or the solemnity of the moment as MPs fell quiet and listened respectfully. But different because this time Sir Keir Starmer was marking the anniversaries of deaths rather than recent ones, which does not happen normally. And he was doing so intentionally to mark in actions, not commentary, what the government thought of the US Vice President JD Vances remarks about the military sacrifices of Americas allies. It is a case study in the dilemma UK ministers face: they are striving to have a close and productive relationship with a White House known for shooting its mouth off. No 10s approach is one of discretion and avoiding the temptation to commentate. Or to put it more crudely, dont get into a slanging match with Team Trump because you are certain to lose. So when European leaders were tapping out various levels of social media opprobrium on Friday evening after President Zelenskys bumpy meeting in Washington, Downing Street were not. The prime minister, we were later told, was on the phone to both President Trump and President Zelensky to try to patch things up. In other words, leveraging the relationship he has with both to try to move things forward: governing, not commentating. Now put yourself in the prime ministers shoes. You are determined to maintain this discipline because you believe it to be sensible, pragmatic and in the UKs national interest. But it is also true, according to opinion polls, that considerably more people in the UK are inclined to be critical of Donald Trump than supportive of him, particularly on his handling of Ukraine. In comparison, Sir Keirs approach is welcomed by many. But what do you do to deal with those who might think Sir Keir is being far too cosy with President Trump, and, crucially, what do you do when his team do something you might regard as egregiously indefensible? The other night JD Vance went on Fox News and claimed that the American plan for Ukraine offered a better security guarantee that 20,000 troops from some random country that hasnt fought a war in 30 or 40 years. There are only two countries that have publicly said that they would provide troops, the UK and France, neither of which the vice president mentioned. But plenty in the UK were outraged by the remarks, whether they were a reference to Britain or not. And the government found a mechanism, in co-opting and reviving a recent ritual, but this time to mark anniversaries, to make its view clear too. When us reporters asked the prime ministers team afterwards why they had done it, they stuck rigidly to their strategy: dont commentate. They didnt, and they didnt need to.

France has a nuclear umbrella. Could its European allies fit under it?,"So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right. As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence. Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours. In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant. From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of Frances sovereign nuclear deterrent  whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security. France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines. The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign  i.e. developed entirely by France  whereas the UK relies on US technical input. On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that Frances deterrence force (force de frappe) could  in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries. His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering sharing its nuclear arsenal. That  according to government officials as well as defence experts  is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be shared. According to Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent is French and will remain French  from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president. What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether Frances nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries. Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the vital interests of France were at stake. The limits of these vital interests have always been left deliberately vague  ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence. In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany. So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to Frances deterrent. What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it. In the past when France has made overtures about extending nuclear protection, other countries were reluctant to respond, says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille. They didnt want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato. But Trump has clarified the debate, Mr Laroche says. Its not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent  lets be clear,...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c871e41751yo,2025-03-08
How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare ahead of her Spring Statement, according to the BBC. When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: Our current situation is unsustainable weve seen a huge rise in that welfare budget. BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall. Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown. At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from 64.7bn in 2023-24 to 100.7bn in 2029-30. And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64. The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from 48.5bn in 2023-24 to 75.7bn in 2029-30. The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts. The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue. In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on. But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them. And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7 in 2024 to a record high of 7.9 in 2029. The reasons for this are not totally clear. Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health. Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30 increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable). Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work. The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is 311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have limited capacity for work-related activity, the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra 416.19 per month on top. But there is no consensus on whats causing the trend. It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase, says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately. Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element o...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crewng29zgno,2025-03-08
Mhairi Black - I was flailing in life until ADHD diagnosis,"From speeches watched by millions to a position as her partys deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars. However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was flailing through life and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC. Black believes it was only through a life-changing diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life. The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her partys performance at last years general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to self-inflected woes. Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20. She said her decision came after years in a toxic and bullying environment that was consuming my entire life, with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018. Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried, she told the BBCs Scotcast podcast. The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again. She said: I couldnt go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went. I didnt understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, Im just beating myself up more, because Im thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that cant cope with it? The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday - shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster. She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency. Westminster didnt have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like Ive no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house, she says. For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a life-changing impact on her life. She told Scotcast: It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, Im not mad, Im just wired differently. It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly. Black compares the condition to the BBCs Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatchs famous detective would use his mind palace to work out cases. It feels like theres constantly three conversations in my head  and a song, she laughs. However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it would get used against me in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by. She recalls: When she Mhairi started telling me about her experiences since...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crknngjpg26o,2025-03-08
Henry Zeffman: Proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments,"The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways. First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellors headroom has been eliminated. This is the 10bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules. Why has that headroom disappeared? The governments clear view is that this is because of global factors - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing. But there will be a big political argument about this. The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reevess Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth. Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government. Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget. Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures. Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts. Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to give families and business more certainty not only about tax but spending changes too. The government did reserve the right to change that approach in the case of an economic shock. Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock? There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts. Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable. There will be reform as well as cuts - Reeves has identified what she sees as perverse incentives in the system. In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship. Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice, they added. However others, including from the left of the party, said ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9degwx4p4jo,2025-03-08
What is stamp duty and how is it changing?,"Home buyers in England and Northern Ireland will pay more stamp duty after 1 April, when two key thresholds are reduced. Mortgage brokers have reported some potential buyers are pulling out of deals because they cannot complete before the end of March. Home buyers race to beat stamp duty rise The seven bills going up in April Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) is a tax due if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland, external. You have to pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than 250,000 dont pay any stamp duty. This limit was temporarily doubled from 125,000 in the September 2022 mini-Budget. The threshold for those buying their first property is 425,000 (when buying a home of less than 625,000), which was raised from 300,000 (when buying a home of less than 500,000), as part of the same mini-Budget.

Henry Zeffman: US aid pause raises stakes for Starmer,"President Trumps decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion. As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmers approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent. The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US. As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum. But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out. It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together. But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge. Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid. He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong. We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days. But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not. It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do. Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister. As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administrations decision and how it will work. And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume. Or, this may be the clearest example that - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different. Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by 20,000 troops from some random country that hasnt fought a war in 30 or 40 years. So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries. Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being. Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to tak...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn89663nqw0o,2025-03-08
Was Starmer's summit enough to sway  Trump?,"Lancaster House may have been bathed in sunshine as European leaders gathered to chart a way forward for Ukraine. But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London. It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine? The prime ministers answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US. He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraines own defensive capabilities, building up the countrys armed forces and border defences to ensure that Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself, according to the official conclusions of the summit. And Sir Keir said there would be a coalition of the willing to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace. Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be a force consisting of European and other partners. The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders. The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop. The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace. Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing. This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russians President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky. The Europeans also wanted to find ways of repairing the transatlantic alliance, which is looking pretty fragile after the confrontation between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday. In recent weeks, the US administration has gone after its European allies; questioning their democracy, voting against them at the United Nations and - in the form of the presidents chief enforcer, Elon Musk - saying even the US should leave the Nato military alliance. The summit in London was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. Diplomats said there was clear resolve around the table to support Ukraine but also to build on Trumps desire to find a ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn04551n6wpo,2025-03-08
Faisal Islam: Any Starmer deal with Trump is all about avoiding tariffs,"The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions. It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position. Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more. There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president, ripping off or screwing the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU. So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards. But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era. It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trumps own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU. It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table. In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its Brexit reset - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office. The narrower economic deal, as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the further integration of our two countries tech sectors. Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what Londons financial City became to New Yorks Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here. This strategy will have consequences. Trumps team are already railing against digital services taxes. The UKs digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2 charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces. While the 700m-1bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big techs revenues, many other countries have followed suit. The White House wants to stop the contagion, and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2 to 12 just four years ago. Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called freedom of speech issues. This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling fr...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedll3282qzo,2025-03-08
Chris Mason: Starmer wins Trump over - but Ukraine uncertainty lingers,"The prime ministers appointment with President Donald Trump, a wildly unpredictable showman of very different political hue, could so easily have been awkward, even excruciating. But it wasnt. As the Downing Street team return to the UK, they are happy with how it went. For some time senior figures were confident they had built a good rapport with Trump. They had hoped too that his love of the UK and the depth of the long standing ties between the two countries would stand them in good stead - but they couldnt be certain. Of course they couldnt be certain, because barely anyone ever can be with Trump. I have been to the White House a handful of times before, but I have never been on a visit like this one. Under President Joe Biden, us reporters would be invited into the Oval Office and then shown out minutes after we were shown in. But Trump, as the BBCs state department correspondent Tom Bateman described it to me when I arrived, is currently governing by news conference. He revels in the circus of performance and flurry of questions, his guests perched next to him occasionally chipping in, occasionally affecting a poker face - hoping there will be nothing said to them so outrageous they are forced to publicly contradict him. LIVE: Latest updates following Starmer-Trump meeting For Sir Keir Starmers visit, Trump cranked up the charm and the warmth. The prime minister cranked up the superlatives and the compliments - and while not quite matching French President Emmanuel Macrons backslapping and knee grabbing, he was more tactile than Ive ever seen him with any other leader. Starmer leant into the theatricality beloved of his host, brandishing - with some performative flourish - the letter from King Charles inviting the president for another state visit. It was stagecraft and statecraft combined in a single moment, neatly pitched for the scenario the prime minister found himself in. The presidents apparent endorsement of the governments plan to cede the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius and rent back the military base there on Diego Garcia - at considerable expense - was a perhaps unlikely fillip too. But the idea still faces opposition at home. The Conservatives question whether it serves the UKs national interest. The proposed UK-US deal Trump made mention of is expected to be narrow, with an initial focus at least on the technology sector. But there does remain considerable uncertainty about the practicalities of a peace plan for Ukraine. The prime minister talked about the importance of winning the peace and not merely stopping the fighting. The UK accepts there is no prospect whatsoever of American troops on the ground in Ukraine, but the government would like the US to provide air cover to protect British and other European peacekeepers.

Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House. Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks. Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed. Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit. Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: Am I supposed to read it right now? After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an honour to visit the fantastic country. He added that King Charles was a beautiful man, a wonderful man. Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting Trumps letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean? During Trumps first term as president, he met King Charless mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019. Sir Keir said Thursdays invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was unprecedented. While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge. The meeting was a pattern weve now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there. During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trumps - dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters. A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other. Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keirs beautiful accent. At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trumps controversial call to make Canada  a member of the Commonwealth  the 51st state of the US. I think youre trying to find a divide that doesnt exist, Sir Keir replied. Trump interjected quickly with the words thats enough before moving on  again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir. To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance. But asked to name their similarities Trump said: He loves his country, and so do I. What else do they share? Trump said: We like each other, frankly, and we like each others country. But the common thread between the two men was that we love our country, Trump said. Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgee7rl24ro,2025-03-08
Did the White House help end the Tate brothers travel ban?,"Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case. Its unclear what, if any, role Donald Trumps administration may have played in their release, but one of Trumps top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romanias Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month. Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media. The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023. They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls defamatory and unequivocally false. On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending. Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings. When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: I know nothing about that. But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania. Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times. And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich. Hurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during that conversation, but denied being pressured to release the pair. The Tate brothers are Trump supporters and also have ties to figures in his administration. One of Tates lawyers now works as White House liaison to the US justice department. Paul Ingrassia was part of a team representing the Tate brothers in a defamation lawsuit they filed in Florida against several of their alleged victims. Ingrassia also acted as Tates publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host. He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate an extraordinary human being who was offering a dying West some hope for renewal. Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trumps orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk. Trump Jr once called Tates detention in Romania absolute insanity. Musk reinstated Andrew Tates account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.

UK looks at Texas supermax prison for ideas to cut overcrowding,"A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares. A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, Where you from, maam? England. Hope you enjoy Estelle, he says. Do you? I ask. A lot better than where I was before. Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter. The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. Theres a scheme here theyd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while theyre inside. Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released. Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment. No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row. Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. Hes already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. Hes a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery. Hes remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison. Im here for taking a life - and Im here to save multiple lives, he says. If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then Ive done my job - even if I never get out of prison. Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government. The good time credit scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, an...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr52399eqgqo,2025-03-08
Chris Mason: Starmer upends Labour manifesto to confront Europe's new reality,"A big moment and a big decision, ahead of a big meeting. The governments announcement that it will crank up defence spending and shrivel the international aid budget amounts to a big shift in strategy, posture and political positioning. Take a look at the Labour Partys election manifesto, written less than a year ago, if you would like proof of that. On page 125, it says: Labour is committed to restoring development spending at the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as soon as fiscal circumstances allow. The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite  cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it. There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind  and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic. Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later. But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence. The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy, as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russias invasion of Ukraine. A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance. Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two. Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean. The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trumps position. Over the coming weeks and months, can a deal be done where the war stops, Ukraine does not feel defeated, Europe does not feel imperilled and transatlantic relations are as near to conventional as possible? It is not going to be easy. The prime ministers trip to the White House is but one building block in developing answers to these questions. And then, over the following weekend, Starmer will host a gathering of European leaders to reflect on where the conversations so far have taken us. President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected in Washington soon too. The next few weeks could prove crucial.

Sinn Féin St Patrick's Day move over Trump policy a gamble,"Boycotting the St Patricks Day celebrations in the White House is a big call by Sinn Féin. Such a snub risks damaging long-standing relationships with key political figures in the US. It could also play badly with the wider Irish diaspora, many of whom are big supporters of Donald Trump. But it is a gamble Sinn Féins leadership are prepared to take. Politically it will feel like the right thing to do given President Trumps previous threat to remove Palestinians from Gaza and attack on Ukraine this week. At the start of the month, Trump put forward a drastic shift in American policy towards the Middle East saying the US will take over the Gaza Strip and turn it into the Riviera of the region. A wave of international criticism met the comments - including from France, Germany and the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who has warned the US against ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Earlier this week, he accused Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky of being a dictator who started the war with Russia. For many it was a step too far, even for those within the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) who had fully supported the new Trump administration. But governments had to walk a thin line by criticising Trumps remarks while not damaging relations with the US. Trumps attacks came after Zelensky, reacting to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia from which Kyiv was excluded, said the US president was living in a disinformation space governed by Moscow. Oppositions parties like Sinn Féin had no such constraints. Eight Irish ministers are travelling to the US next month including Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin. It will feel like an easy hit for Sinn Féin given the wider public outrage against President Trump. But the decision by Northern Irelands first minister to announce her Washington boycott in Dublin will not be lost on her unionist political opponents. For them this will feel like a political strategy born in Dublin and not Belfast. The focus will now fall on Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly who was keen to travel to Washington. Though it is a joint office, she could still travel to the US as long as the move is not vetoed by the first minister which seems unlikely. If that happens Northern Ireland will be represented in the White House but not by the joint ministers.",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd354xjnl2o,2025-03-08
The Chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP,"Rachel Reeves has had a difficult start to her ministerial career. As well as Labours new chancellor taking on the challenges of the UK economy, she has faced tricky questions about her past. They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year. On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed to have worked as an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) immediately before becoming an MP. One of those who challenged it was a retired former colleague, Kev Gillett. In a public post on LinkedIn, which he asked followers to share, he wrote: Back in 2009 Rt Hon Rachel Reeves worked 3 levels below me. Just facts. She was a Complaints Support Manager at LBGHBOS. Not an Economist. factcheck. In fact it emerged that she had worked in a managerial role within the banks complaint handling department and her LinkedIn profile was updated to remove the claim. Rachel Reevess online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England Gillett also made another claim about Reevess time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses. Reevess team vigorously denied the allegations. However, Labours imminent victory in last summers general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves. One former employee replied: the expenses dept certainly do! Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending. BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents. We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers. A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the banks money to fund a lifestyle with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other. We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded. But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the banks risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblowers allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation. A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms. Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.

Who is Rachel Reeves?,"Rachel Reeves has had a bumpy first few months in government. Her tax-hiking Budget prompted criticism from businesses and farmers, and despite Labour putting a pledge to boost the economy at the centre of its plans, growth has been sluggish. Now the chancellor is facing questions about whether she exaggerated her experience on her online CV and her use of expenses while working in the banking sector before she became an MP. Reeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change. She has previously told the BBC her mother would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: We werent poor, but we didnt have money to waste. Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes. During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering. They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money. Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Browns prudence in the lead-up to Labours 1997 election win. Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would quietly thrash any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie. She has credited chess with teaching her to think ahead, to plan a strategy. A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenhams Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level. Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of two pre-fab huts in the playground, she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party. She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destinys Child songs and dressing up in her room. Despite her serious demeanour, colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MPs public persona does not reflect her human side, including a loud laugh and a deep love of Beyoncé tracks. Age: 46 Place of birth: Lewisham, south-east London Education: New College, Oxford and the London School of Economics Family: Married to Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant and former speechwriter to Gordon Brown during his time as chancellor.

Trump Seeks to Bar Student Loan Relief to Workers Aiding Migrants and Trans Kids,"President Trump signed an executive order instructing administration officials to alter a student loan forgiveness program for public servants to exclude nonprofit organizations that engage in activities that have what he called a substantial illegal purpose. His order to restrict the program appears to target groups supporting undocumented immigrants, diversity initiatives or gender-affirming care for children, among others, as the Trump administration has sought to eliminate federal support for efforts that have drawn right-wing ire. The order, made public on Friday, is the latest of many attempts to overhaul the loan forgiveness program, which has often whipsawed borrowers with rule changes and bureaucratic obstacles. The program, known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, was created by Congress in 2007 and cannot be eliminated without congressional action, but the Education Department has some leeway to determine how it operates. Mr. Trumps executive order directed the secretaries of education and the Treasury to amend the program to exclude workers for organizations supporting illegal actions, listing several categories of examples, including aiding or abetting violations of federal immigration law. The Trump administration has taken a broad view of what it considers to be support of illegal activities. The order cited as examples organizations that support illegal discrimination, which the administration has previously said includes diversity and inclusion initiatives. The order appeared to target groups supporting gender-affirming care. It said it would exclude from the loan forgiveness program any organization supporting child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.

Trump Offers to Reopen Nuclear Talks in a Letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader,"President Trump said on Friday that he had sent a letter to Irans supreme leader offering to reopen negotiations over the countrys fast-advancing nuclear program, but warned that the country would have to choose between curbing its fast-expanding program or losing it in a military attack. Speaking on Friday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump suggested that Irans nuclear capabilities  which now include enough near-bomb-grade fuel to produce about six weapons  were reaching a critical point. Were down to final strokes with Iran, he told reporters. We cant let them have a nuclear weapon. Earlier on Friday on Fox Business, Mr. Trump said: There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because Im not looking to hurt Iran. Theyre great people. He said the letter was sent Wednesday and addressed to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Irans supreme leader. The White House did not provide the text or describe its contents with any specificity. It was unclear if it was sent through the Swiss  the traditional intermediary for communications between Washington and Tehran  or through Russia or another nation. Mr. Trumps offer echoes a similar message to Iran during his first term, after he announced in 2018 that he was pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal that had been negotiated three years earlier by the Obama administration. But he never got talks started, and an effort by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. collapsed. Now, the strategic environment has changed radically. The Justice Department has accused Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of seeking to assassinate Mr. Trump last year; it issued indictments before Mr. Biden left office. Irans nuclear facilities are now exposed to attack, after Israel destroyed almost all of the air defenses protecting them in October. And Irans regional proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, are in no condition to threaten Israel with retaliation should the Iranian facilities come under attack.

C.D.C. Will Investigate Debunked Link Between Vaccines and Autism,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to conduct a large-scale study to re-examine whether there is a connection between vaccines and autism, federal officials said Friday. Dozens of scientific studies have failed to find evidence of a link. But the C.D.C. now falls under the purview of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long expressed skepticism about the safety of vaccines and has vowed to revisit the data. As President Trump said in his Joint Address to Congress, the rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. C.D.C. will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening, Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement Friday. Mr. Nixon did not offer details about the scope or methods of the project. News of the study was first reported Friday morning by Reuters. In pursuing the study, the C.D.C. is defying the wishes of the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy, who said this week that further research into any supposed link between vaccines and autism would be a waste of money and a distraction from research that might shed light on the true reason for a rise in autism rates. Its been exhaustively studied, Mr. Cassidy, a doctor, said during the confirmation hearing for Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, President Trumps nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health. The more we pretend like this is an issue, the more we will have children dying from vaccine-preventable diseases. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump Administration Sends Politically Charged Survey to Researchers,"The Trump administration has asked researchers and organizations whose work is conducted overseas to disclose ties to those regarded as hostile, including entities associated with communist, socialist or totalitarian parties, according to a questionnaire obtained by The New York Times. The online survey was sent this week to groups working abroad to research diseases like H.I.V., gather surveillance data and strengthen public health systems. Recipients received funding from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Agency for International Development and other federal sources. The questionnaire appears to be very similar to one sent earlier this week to partners of the United States Agency for International Development, which has been all but dismantled by the Trump administration. Both were titled Foreign Assistance Review. Recipients were instructed to respond within 48 hours. Some grantees interviewed by The Times feared that impolitic or unsatisfactory answers could lead to cancellation of funding. Taxpayer dollars must not fund dependency, socialism, corrupt regimes that oppose free enterprise, or intervene in internal matters of another sovereign nation, the questionnaire said. A truly prosperous America prioritizes domestic growth, innovation, and economic strength over foreign handouts, it added. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Homeland Security Department Says It Is Ending Its Union Contract with TSA Workers,"The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it was ending its collective bargaining agreement with workers in the Transportation Security Administration, claiming that the union contract was imperiling the safety of travelers. The move was the latest step by President Trumps administration to undermine labor protections for federal workers, and prompted an outraged response from the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents some 47,000 at the T.S.A., along with hundreds of thousands of other federal workers. The union vowed to fight the action, saying that it had little do with safety and appeared to be illegal. The move could lay the groundwork for the government to fire T.S.A. workers and perhaps even privatize the agency, according to labor experts. Project 2025, a conservative policy playbook that Mr. Trump distanced himself from during the presidential campaign but has since followed, called for privatizing the T.S.A. The T.S.A., which has about 50,000 workers in the field and makes up about a quarter of the Homeland Security Departments work force, is tasked with securing the nations airports, highways and passenger rail system. It was created in 2002 in response to the Sept. 11 attacks and folded into the Homeland Security Department in 2003. In a statement on Friday, the Homeland Security Department claimed that a select few poor performers in the T.S.A. were exploiting benefits and suggested that too many employees were devoting time to union matters rather than security work. Eliminating collective bargaining removes bureaucratic hurdles, the statement said, adding that the union had constrained efforts to keep Americans safe. Everett Kelley, the unions president, said in a statement that this action has nothing to do with efficiency, safety or homeland security. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

What the Recent Cabinet Blowup Means for Musk,"Yesterday, President Trump did something hes seemingly been loath to do in the first seven weeks of his new administration: He reined in Elon Musk. My colleagues Jonathan Swan and Maggie Haberman have the details of the extraordinary cabinet meeting where everything unfolded, and youre going to want to read every word. After Musk berated Secretary of State Marco Rubio for having fired nobody, Rubio pushed back while Trump watched. Musk scoffed that Rubio was merely good on TV. Sean Duffy, a former star of MTVs Real World who knows what it means to be good on television  and is now the secretary of transportation  played his own role in the conflict earlier in the meeting, when he spoke in defense of air traffic controllers, some of whom, he said, Musks aides were trying to fire. What was clear was that some of the nations cabinet secretaries had hit their breaking point with Musks efforts to steamroll the federal government. And while Trump said he still supported Musks mission, he gave his secretaries something they wanted. As Jonathan and Maggie wrote: From now on, he said, the secretaries would be in charge; the Musk team would only advise. The encounter stood as the first indication that Trump is willing to put some limits on the billionaire, even if those limits would do little more than bring the realities of Musks wide-ranging role more in line with how the administrations lawyers have described it in court. But the limits, if they hold, could raise bigger questions about the role Musk will play in the government going forward  especially if his history in the business world is any guide. Ryan Mac, a colleague of mine who covers big tech, has reported on Musk for a long time. Today, I asked him if Musk had ever been content with an adviser-style role, one in which he doesnt run the show. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump Administration Forces Out More Senior Justice Dept. Officials,"The Trump administration on Friday forced out a handful of senior Justice Department officials, further thinning the ranks of career officials who help guide the agency, according to several people familiar with the actions. The ouster of lawyers managing the Justice Departments pardon work, bankruptcy litigation and other legal issues marks the latest move by the new administration to remove or reassign senior officials with many years of experience. The official overseeing the Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles internal ethics investigations, was also removed from that role, though he was placed on administrative leave, these people said. The removals follow a pattern that has fueled turmoil and alarm inside the Justice Department as the new administration seeks to take control of the agency and reshape it with an emphasis on loyalty to President Trump. The Justice Departments pardon attorney, Elizabeth Oyer, posted on LinkedIn that she had been fired from the job I have poured my heart and soul into for the last three years. In the post, she shared her dismissal letter, which was signed by the newly confirmed deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, a former criminal defense lawyer for Mr. Trump. Two Justice Department spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Attorney General Pam Bondi has vowed to end what she calls the weaponization of the department, claiming without much explanation or evidence that prosecutors improperly pursued criminal cases against Mr. Trump during the Biden administration. Critics of the Trump administrations recent personnel changes inside the Justice Department argue that they will significantly weaken the authority of career law enforcement officials, and instead empower pro-Trump partisans to pursue the presidents goal of punishing his perceived enemies.

"At Crypto Summit, Trump Says U.S. Will Be ‘the Bitcoin Superpower’","Sitting beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, more than two dozen of the most powerful figures in the U.S. cryptocurrency industry, together worth many billions of dollars, gathered in the White House on Friday for an audience with President Trump. When Mr. Trump entered the ornate State Dining Room after a short wait, the executives rose to applaud him. Many of you have been fighting for years for this, Mr. Trump said as the room quieted. Its an honor to be with you at the White House. Mr. Trump was holding a first-of-its-kind crypto summit, meeting face to face with the leaders of virtually all of the top crypto companies in the United States. Only a small portion of the gathering, which was scheduled to last four hours, was broadcast to the public. But it offered a vivid illustration of Mr. Trumps recent embrace of crypto, a renegade industry that has spent years battling with U.S. regulators. Several executives, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, offered words of gratitude to Mr. Trump. They called him wonderful, saying they were overjoyed with his approach. High I.Q. individuals around this table, Mr. Trump responded. Since he took office, Mr. Trump has orchestrated a complete transformation of federal policy on crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission has almost entirely reversed an aggressive campaign by the Biden administration to crack down on the industry. The agency, moving with astonishing speed, has issued legal guidance to help crypto companies, ended investigations into major firms and dropped lawsuits against two of the largest exchanges, Coinbase and Kraken.

Trump’s Delay on Mexico and Canada Tariffs Came in Response to Market Revolt,"A month ago, President Trump announced that he would impose sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico before reaching a last-minute deal to delay them for 30 days. This week, after markets revolted when the tariffs were put in place, Mr. Trump watered them down with a monthlong reprieve for automakers. And then on Thursday, he opened up even broader exemptions for many other products that are imported from Americas neighbors to the north and south after intense lobbying from business groups that warned of rising prices. Mr. Trump has spent the last month or so bouncing between imposing sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and delaying them because of last-minute deals. There will, he said, always be changes and adjustments. Despite Mr. Trumps insistence that tariff is among his favorite words, the waffling over import duties reflects the reality that steep import taxes are not an antidote for every policy problem facing the nation. Mr. Trumps economic advisers continue to contend that the tariffs are part of a broader agenda that will not damage the economy. However, the delays and loopholes reveal that they are beginning to see the risks of taking tariffs too far at a time when the economy is showing signs of strain and consumers are still reeling from inflation.

Lawyers Plan to Sue Federal Government on Behalf of Jan. 6 Rioters,"A team of lawyers is preparing to sue the federal government on behalf of hundreds of people pardoned by President Trump for their role in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, claiming that the rioters were mistreated by agencies like the Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons. The lawyers leading the effort include Mark McCloskey, who rose to prominence five years ago after he pointed an AR-15-style rifle at social justice protesters outside his home in St. Louis, and Peter Ticktin, a former classmate and longtime ally of Mr. Trump. Even before Mr. Trump granted clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people prosecuted in connection with Jan. 6, many defendants had been itching to seek damages from the federal government. The presidents sweeping reprieves have only emboldened them in their efforts to claim they are the victims, not the perpetrators, of the attack. Any attempt to sue the federal government over Jan. 6 could face an uphill climb in court, although in this instance the lawyers could be aided by the government itself. It remains unclear at this point how Justice Department officials appointed by Mr. Trump might handle a case claiming that federal prosecutors, F.B.I. agents and prison guards mistreated Jan. 6 defendants. The department could decide not to mount a robust defense and simply seek to settle any claims before they go to trial. A handful of rioters  including one with ties to the Proud Boys and another with connections to the Oath Keepers militia  have already filed suit against federal officials and local law enforcement agencies in Washington. But those cases have not gained much traction in the courts. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Trump Organization Sues Capital One for Closing Its Accounts,"President Trumps family business sued Capital One on Friday for unjustifiably terminating more than 300 of its bank accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the latest sign that the president and his allies are seeking retribution against those who once shunned them. In a complaint filed in state court in Florida, the Trump Organization accused the bank of arbitrarily closing its accounts in June 2021 in violation of various consumer protection laws. The accounts held millions of dollars at the time, according to the lawsuit. By filing this lawsuit, we seek to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods, the company said in a statement. The bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, did not provide a reason at the time for closing the accounts, the lawsuit said. But in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when Mr. Trumps supporters stormed the Capitol, a number of financial institutions cut ties with his familys real estate business. The groups lawsuit against Capital One could portend similar actions against other banks. More to come, Eric Trump, one of the plaintiffs and the leader of the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Friday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How Foreign Aid Cuts Are Setting the Stage for Disease Outbreaks,"Dangerous pathogens left unsecured at labs across Africa. Halted inspections for mpox, Ebola and other infections at airports and other checkpoints. Millions of unscreened animals shipped across borders. The Trump administrations pause on foreign aid has hobbled programs that prevent and snuff out outbreaks around the world, scientists say, leaving people everywhere more vulnerable to dangerous pathogens. That includes Americans. Outbreaks that begin overseas can travel quickly: The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, for example, but it soon appeared everywhere, including the United States. When polio or dengue appears in this country, cases are usually linked to international travel. Its actually in the interest of American people to keep diseases down, said Dr. Githinji Gitahi, who heads Amref Health Africa, a large nonprofit that relies on the United States for about 25 percent of its funding. Diseases make their way to the U.S. even when we have our best people on it, and now we are not putting our best people on it, he added. In interviews, more than 30 current and former officials of the United States Agency for International Development, members of health organizations and experts in infectious diseases described a world made more perilous than it was just a few weeks ago.

Trump ‘Strongly Considering’ New Sanctions on Russia to Force Cease-Fire Deal,"President Trump said on Friday that he was strongly considering imposing sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and permanent peace deal was reached in its war with Ukraine, even as he defended Russias stepped-up attacks on Ukraine after the United States paused aid and intelligence sharing. Asked in the Oval Office on Friday whether he believed Mr. Putin was taking advantage of the situation, which resulted from a tense Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine last month, Mr. Trump defended Mr. Putins actions, saying hes doing what anybody else would do. I think hes hitting him harder than hes been hitting him, Mr. Trump said. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now. It was the latest about-face for Mr. Trump, coming just hours after threatening sanctions, but also a return to aligning himself with President Vladimir V. Putins narrative of the war. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has falsely accused Kyiv of starting it, even though Ukraine was invaded by Russia, and accused Mr. Zelensky of being the dictator who didnt want peace. Mr. Trumps remarks came hours after Russia unleashed a furious bombardment aimed at critical Ukrainian infrastructure overnight on Thursday and Friday. Ukraines energy minister, German Galushchenko, said Russian forces launched a massive missile and drone assault on power and gas facilities across the country. In an early morning post announced on his social media site, Truth Social, Mr. Trump said he was strongly considering imposing what he described as large scale sanctions, including on banks, because of the perilous state of the war, now in its fourth year.

Powell Says the Fed Is in No Hurry to Adjust Rates Amid Trump Policy Uncertainty,"Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said the central bank is focused on the net effect of President Trumps sweeping economic agenda amid high uncertainty about which policies will actually be enacted, as he reiterated that officials are still not in a hurry to adjust interest rates. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves, Mr. Powell said at an event on Friday. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity. If inflation stays sticky but the economy remains strong, the Fed chair said the central bank can maintain policy restraint for longer. But if either the labor market were to weaken more than expected, or inflation were to rapidly decline, Mr. Powell said officials can ease policy accordingly. His comments underscore the delicate balancing act that Fed is trying to navigate at a tenuous moment for the economy. Speaking at the same event earlier on Friday, Michelle Bowman, a Fed governor, said that as inflation returns to the central banks 2 percent target, the labor market and economic activity will become a larger factor in policy discussions. The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent when officials gather March 18-19, extending a pause that has been in place since January. But its decisions after that point may get more fraught, especially if the economy weakens and price pressures rise to the extent that economists fear.

Rubio and Trump Officials Clash With Elon Musk in an Explosive Meeting,"Marco Rubio was incensed. Here he was in the Cabinet Room of the White House, the secretary of state, seated beside the president and listening to a litany of attacks from the richest man in the world. Seated diagonally opposite, across the elliptical mahogany table, Elon Musk was letting Mr. Rubio have it, accusing him of failing to slash his staff. You have fired nobody, Mr. Musk told Mr. Rubio, then scornfully added that perhaps the only person he had fired was a staff member from Mr. Musks Department of Government Efficiency. Mr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubios control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting on Thursday in front of President Trump and around 20 others  details of which have not been reported before  Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest. Mr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement in buyouts? Didnt they count as layoffs? He asked, sarcastically, whether Mr. Musk wanted him to rehire all those people just so he could make a show of firing them again. Then he laid out his detailed plans for reorganizing the State Department. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Data, waves and wind to be counted in the economy","Wind and wave power is set to be included in calculations of the size of countries economies for the first time, as part of changes approved at the United Nations. Assets like oilfields were already factored in under the rules - last updated in 2008. This update aims to capture areas that have grown since then, such as the cost of using up natural resources and the value of data. The changes come into force in 2030, and could mean an increase in estimates of the size of the UK economy making promises to spend a fixed share of the economy on defence or aid more expensive. The economic value of wind and waves can be estimated from the price of all the energy that can be generated from the turbines in a country. The update also treats data as an asset in its own right on top of the assets that house it like servers and cables. Governments use a common rule book for measuring the size of their economies and how they grow over time. These changes to the rule book are tweaks, rather than a rewrite, according to Prof Diane Coyle of the University of Cambridge. Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calls it an accounting change, rather than a real change. He explains: Wed be no better off in a material sense, and tax revenues would be no higher. But it could make economies look bigger, creating a possible future spending headache for the UK government. For example, Labour has committed to allocating fixed percentages of the size of the economy on defence and aid. If the new rules increase the estimated size of the economy by 2-3 in 2030, it might add 2bn to defence spending. That is a tiny share of the total government budget, but large compared with the cuts to overseas aid (6bn) that are currently funding extra defence spending or the headroom that the government has left to meet its self-imposed fiscal rules (10bn). The government spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will not be including the impact of these new rules on the government finances in their assessment of the government finances this March. This makes the new rules a possible future headache for the Chancellor rather than an immediate one.

Tesco trials giant trolley scales in Gateshead,"Giant trolley scales are being trialled at a Tesco store in Gateshead sparking a mixed reaction from shoppers. Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice. But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. Am I at border control or Tesco? one Reddit user posted, while another joked No clubcard? Deported! Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment. Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end. Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items theyve scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley. Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying they are 10x more convenient and faster, many were more critical of their introduction. More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief, one said, while another wrote the point of all this is to save on staff. Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs. There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. Its supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed. He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts. This is supermarkets saying, we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft. Theyre forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers dont feel trusted or think theyre being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else. The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is out of control after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers 2bn. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23 to more than 492,000 over the same period. That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003. Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was definitely an element of trying to control loss but added lets not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental. A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43 had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found. Prof Taylor said Tescos scal...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rzvrjkklko,2025-03-08
Trump 'strongly considering' large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia,"US President Donald Trump has said he is strongly considering large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal with Ukraine is reached. Trump said he was contemplating the move because Russia is absolutely pounding Ukraine on the battlefield right now. Trumps comments marked a sharp change in tone. Since coming into office, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraines leader for not wanting peace with Russia. Hours later, however, the US president told reporters he was finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine, and repeated that he trusted Putin. Last Friday, Trump berated Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Days earlier, he had even called him a dictator and blamed Ukraine for starting the war which began on 24 February 2022 when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighbouring country. The public dressing-down was followed this week by Trump pausing all US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. It is not clear if this enabled Russias large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraines energy infrastructure on Thursday night. On Friday morning, Trump issued his threat of sanctions tariffs against Russia - apparently over the attack. They Russia are bombing the hell out of them Ukraine right now... and I put a statement out, a very strong statement cant do that, cant do that, Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. Asked if that was a result of the US pause in military co-operation with Ukraine, Trump said Putin was doing what anyone else would do. And he justified the US move by saying: I want to know they Ukraine want to settle and I dont know they want to settle. In Fridays post, Trump wrote: I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. He did not provide any details as to how such sanctions and tariffs against Russia may work. Moscow is already under the heaviest Western sanctions in its history, many of which target its oil exports and foreign currency reserves. It has been able to get around them to a large extent by selling discounted oil to India and China, while importing many of the goods it previously got from the West through countries like Kazakhstan. China is reported to be helping to sustain Russias war effort with large volumes of dual-use technology, which it denies. The White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia. So it is possible that Trumps threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed. The problem is, we simply do not know what was discussed and what was agreed in that lengthy and highly productive 90-minute phone call that Donald Trump suddenly announced he had held last month with the Russian president. So far, ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkpy3497o,2025-03-08
Price of first-class stamp to rise to £1.70,"The cost of a first-class stamp will rise by 5p to 1.70 on 7 April, Royal Mail has announced. It will also raise the price of a second-class stamp by 2p to 87p on the same day. The company said the decision carefully considered balancing affordability with the increasing cost of delivering mail. Citizens Advice described the change as yet another blow to consumers, and said the change to the second class price was unjust. The number of letters Royal Mail delivers has fallen from a peak of 20 billion in 2004-05 to 6.6 billion last year. However, the price of stamps has continued to rise. Since 2022, Royal Mail has already hiked the cost of a first-class stamp five times from 85p to 1.65. The next increase, in April, was the result - it said - of delivering fewer letters to more addresses. We always consider price changes very carefully but the cost of delivering mail continues to increase, said Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail. A complex and extensive network of trucks, planes and 85,000 posties is needed to ensure we can deliver across the country for just 87p. But consumer advocate Citizens Advice said millions of people would be forced to pay more while also suffering from postal delays. Its unjust for Royal Mail to raise the price of a second-class stamp, while the regulator Ofcom looks at reducing second-class deliveries to alternate weekdays, said Tom MacInnes, the charitys director of policy. As first-class stamps are becoming unaffordable, people could be forced by price pressures into choosing a slower service. In January, regulator Ofcom proposed that Royal Mail should only deliver second-class letters every other weekday and not on Saturdays to protect the future of the UKs postal industry. The one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO) means Royal Mail has to deliver post six days a week, from Monday to Saturday, and parcels on five from Monday to Friday. Ofcom has launched a consultation on the new proposals, which is open to the public until 10 April. A decision is expected in the summer. Royal Mails parent company is being sold to a business controlled by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky in a deal worth 3.6bn, after the Labour government approved the deal last year. The government will maintain a golden share which means Mr Kretinskys business will have to get approval for any changes to Royal Mails ownership, the location of its headquarters and its tax residency. Royal Mail must also adhere to the USO, which Mr Kretinsky has pledged he will do for as long as I am alive.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwygl9vj28do,2025-03-08
US job growth stable as government cuts start,"US President Donald Trumps cuts to the government workforce have started to hit, but overall hiring last month remained stable as growth in other sectors offset those losses. The Labor Department said federal employment dropped by 10,000 in February. Across the economy, employers added 151,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1, from 4 in January. The monthly report from the government is a closely-watched signal of economic health that was under particular scrutiny this month, amid rising concern about the economic disruption sparked by Trump administration policy changes. Analysts had been forecasting about 170,000 new jobs. The monthly gain in February was similar to the average monthly rise of 168,000 over the past year, the Labor Department said. Hiring was driven by healthcare and financial firms. The manufacturing sector also added about 10,000 jobs, gains that were highlighted by the Trump administration. Government hiring slowed sharply, while analysts cautioned that the report did not yet reflect the full extent of the cuts that the White House has announced. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the report felt reassuringly in line with expectations, showing payrolls growth only modestly weaker than in recent months. Yet, while the worst fears were not met, the report does confirm that the labour market is cooling, she warned. Furthermore, with no shortage of headwinds confronting the US economy, the softening trend is likely to persist and may potentially deepen given the toxic combination of federal government layoffs, public spending cuts, and tariff uncertainty related inertia. Even before Donald Trump took office as president, financial analysts had been surprised at the long-running streak of growth in the US labour market, which came despite pressure from price increases and high interest rates. In his first weeks, Trumps changes to US policy have added to pressures on the economy, generating widespread uncertainty. His changes include tariffs on Americas top three trade partners, some of which have since been reversed, and cuts to federal jobs and spending, efforts that are facing challenges in the courts. In remarks at the White House, Trump acknowledged that there could be some disturbance in the economy. But he said he thought reducing the size of government and moving forward with tariffs would unleash private sector growth. I think the labour markets going to be fantastic but its going to have high-paying manufacturing jobs as opposed to government jobs, he said, adding that he could not commit to policy certainty on trade. There will always be changes, he said. Polls indicate that the moves have the support of his base. But financial analysts have warned that they are contributing to worries in financial markets, hurting consumer sentiment and fuelling weakness across a range of other economic indicators. The latest jobs report showed average hourly pay up 4 compared with ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czedwgrwp32o,2025-03-08
Boots gets new US owner in multi-billion dollar deal,"The US owner of the Boots pharmacy chain is being taken over by a private equity firm in a 10bn (7.8bn) deal. The price being paid for Walgreens Boots Alliance is a fraction of what the company was worth a decade ago, reflecting its struggles with growing debt and shoppers going online for cheaper products. There have been reports that the Boots chain could be sold off separately by its new owner, US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Walgreens chief executive Tim Wentworth said the firm was navigating the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape. While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company, he added. George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBCs Today programme that Boots had been in and out of different ownership for some time and that its business model has struggled. People are buying more of those personal healthcare brands online than they are in the shop. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Savvy Marketing, said there would be a lot of interested parties if the Boots business was put up for sale. She said the company had turned itself around after going through a difficult period and it was an unbelievably trusted brand with a unique place in the UK psyche. There are now 1,900 Boots stores left in the UK after the pharmacy chain began closing shops in June 2023 as part of a shake up. Ms Shuttleworth said reports of a Boots sale would be difficult for staff. Any uncertainty over your ownership is going to make you quite concerned if you work for Boots. Boots has been contacted for comment. Sycamore Partners is paying 11.45 per share for Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is more than its shares are currently worth on the US stock market. Walgreens shares rose by nearly 6 in extended trading in New York. But the companys stock market value has fallen by around 80 over the past five years. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The Illinois-based Walgreens took a 45 stake in Boots in 2012. It bought the remainder of the firm two years later in a deal that valued Boots at around 9bn. Walgreens is also made up of its namesake US retail business, specialty pharmacy group Shields Health Solutions and healthcare provider VillageMD. In recent years, the company has faced mounting challenges as customers turned to cheaper rivals. In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale but later dropped these plans, saying potential buyers had been unable to raise enough funds. In October, it announced plans to shut 1,200 Walgreens stores in the US over the next three years under a cost-cutting programme.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq0p27z69o,2025-03-08
Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remain,"Theres one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed. All the while, the autonomous machines on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat. The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean. Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts. We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint, explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals. The firms system is 95 accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says. The robots arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses  they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance. Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however. Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology, says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF. Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. If youre not sure whats down there, then leave it alone, says John Childs at Lancaster University. Thats been the widespread position from science to date. Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe. In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later. Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies. Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019. Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition. Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact. No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July. Mr Gunasekaras firm is currently building a larger version of its...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45zwe0v0ro,2025-03-08
"Post Office compensation offer after death is 'slap in the face', says widow","A widow whose husband was caught up in the Post Office Horizon scandal is calling for compensation payments for victims to be sped up after she received her husbands offer of redress days after he passed away. Terry Walters, 76, died in February after years of ill health. He was one of the former sub-postmasters who took the Post Office to court in the landmark case led by Sir Alan Bates, which helped expose the scandal. Despite submitting a claim for full financial redress more than a year ago, he died without receiving all the money he was owed. The government says it has doubled the amount of payments made to former sub-postmasters. Days after losing Terry, his widow Janet received a letter making an offer of compensation  far below the amount the couple had claimed. She describes the offer as a slap in the face and says it has prompted her to share their story publicly for the first time. Enough is enough, she said. Terry used his redundancy money to take over the Hockley Post Office in Stockport in 2005. But less than two years later, he was suspended for alleged shortfalls. He was never allowed back behind his counter again and his contract was terminated the following year for thousands of pounds of losses that didnt exist. He and Janet had to sell their home and have been living in rented accommodation ever since. To have a big institution such as the Post Office come along and accuse you of doing something  it was devastating, says Janet, and humiliating. Now, ahead of Terrys funeral, Janet has decided to share their story  and is urging the government to ensure quick payment to others who are still waiting for compensation. Weve lived on promises all this time, she adds. Seventeen years out of somebodys life is a long time. There are no official figures for how many victims have died before receiving full compensation but, according to The Times, the number had reached more than 250 by early 2024. Terry had received an interim payment, which Janet says helped them manage as his health declined. But she insists that Terry would have been over the moon had he lived to receive his full compensation. She believes that receiving the money in the years before Terrys health declined could have made a huge difference to their quality of life. We could have done the things we had wanted to do all these years, buy a proper home perhaps, treat ourselves to a nice holiday, go out and do things, she said. According to the most recent figures, in the scheme created to provide redress for those in the original Group Litigation Order (GLO), 227 of 492 eligible claimants are still waiting for full and final compensation. The government says 407 offers have been made of the 425 people who have so far made full claims. With so many others still waiting for their full compensation, Janet now says she is considering writing to King Charles. There must be someone in a high authority that can say, well, its time this was finished, she says, so people have a c...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ernpd0k22o,2025-03-08
'A pig in lipstick': Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve criticised,"President Donald Trumps decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers. He has signed an executive order creating what he calls a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will consist of other forms of digital currency. The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings. White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency, drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets. However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process. Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal governments existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. Thats worth 17.5bn (13.6bn) at todays prices. Speaking to reporters at the White House ahead of a special crypto summit on Friday, Sacks said that it was a real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer. What we want to do is make sure that with the remaining Bitcoin that we have, he added. Nonetheless, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, called Thursdays announcement a pig in lipstick in response to Sacks post on X. No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government, he said. Trumps executive order says that the Treasury and Commerce secretary will come up with strategies for acquiring more government Bitcoin, provided these are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers. That meant, Sacks told reporters, they are only allowed to buy more if it doesnt add to the deficit or the debt. Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a horrible precedent and makes no sense. Without a clear framework, we risk arbitrary asset selections, which would distort the markets and drive a loss of public trust, he suggested. Other analysts though have been more positive. This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globes reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence. Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House. It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it will not cost taxpayers a dime. It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress. The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset.

Trump expands exemptions from Canada and Mexico tariffs,"US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week. It is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from the USs two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets. On Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25 import levies just a day after they came into effect. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canadas finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a colourful conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump. The US president used profane language more than once during Wednesdays heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports. Trudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief. Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed, he said. Sheinbaum said she had had an excellent and respectful call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way. The carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North Americas free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term. Items that currently come into the US under the pacts rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25 to 10. A White House official said about 50 of US imports from Mexico and 62 from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order. The White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored reciprocal trade duties on countries around the world. The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence. The SP 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, ended down nearly 1.8 on Thursday. George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said the hokey cokey with Trumps tariffs has it made it nigh on impossible for firms to manage their production lines and is putting pressure on the US economy. Meanwhile, he said it is galvanising a response from Europe, especially Germany, so weve seen a more positive reaction to European markets. In signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market.

Home buyers race to beat stamp duty rise,"Home buyers are scrambling to complete purchases by the end of the month or face paying thousands of pounds extra in stamp duty. First-time buyers in particular could be hit when stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland change on 1 April. One couple said they felt like they were in a race, and our prize is 11,000. Lenders say a significant swathe of the country will be drawn into paying the tax, but the government says it is helping more people to buy their first home. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than 250,000 do not pay stamp duty land tax, but this will revert to 125,000 from 1 April. For most first-time buyers the threshold is currently 425,000, but this will fall back to 300,000 in April. The increases to the thresholds had been introduced during the September 2022 mini-Budget. Paul Gorton featured in the 2024 series of cult reality TV series The Traitors. The 37-year-old and his partner Kate Waldron now face another episode of high jeopardy to complete the purchase of their first home in time. Were on a knife edge, weve got weeks, otherwise its going to cost us a large chunk for no reason, Mr Gorton said. They are trying to buy a property in Congleton, Cheshire. Ms Waldron, 34, said it was a particularly stressful time because she only gave birth to baby Cooper three months ago. They already have two-year-old Charlie and a dog called Buddy. Were doing it all at once. Its an added stress with this deadline looming over us, she said. Missing that deadline would cost them 6,500, despite having put all their money into the deposit, and facing the prospect of regular bills and nursery fees. Karen Potter, an estate agent in Southport, has about 37 clients in the danger zone of missing the deadline. In a stressful arena anyway, weve got this panic where theres another source of strain and stress for them, she said. Property portal Rightmove has estimated that in England, some 25,000 first-time buyers and 74,000 home movers, in the buying process, would be unable to complete in time to beat the deadline. Mortgage brokers have reported buyers pulling out of deals because they could not move before the end of March. The proportion of areas in England in which the average first-time buyer home falls into the scope of stamp duty will rise from 8.4 to 32 on 1 April, according to analysis by the Skipton Group, which includes a building society and estate agency. Stamp duty has always been a more common issue for buyers in the south east of England, where house prices are higher. Some will face higher stamp duty bills owing to the changing thresholds, which include the first-time buyer relief being available only to those buying a property for less than 500,000, rather than less than 625,000. Jonah Kavanagh and Elle Van Petersen are hoping to buy their first home together in Guildford. They, and their sellers, are pulling out all the stops to get the move completed in time. Failure to do so would cost them 11,000 extra in stamp du...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm1wre28dzo,2025-03-08
"SpaceX rocket explodes, raining debris from sky for second time in a row","A SpaceX rocket exploded shortly after it was launched from Texas on Thursday, grounding flights and triggering warnings about falling spaceship debris. SpaceX confirmed the un-crewed ship had suffered a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent into space, and lost contact with the ground. The massive SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever created, spun out of control shortly after its launch. No injuries or damage have been reported but images from those in Caribbean Sea island nations show fiery debris raining from the sky. This was the eighth mission to test the rocket, and its second consecutive failure. The spaceship, which measures 123m (403ft) at takeoff, was meant to re-enter Earths orbit over the Indian Ocean after a one-hour flight. Its Super Heavy booster, which helps it leave the ground, did manage successfully to return to the launchpad. SpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said teams immediately started co-ordinating with safety officials for pre-planned contingency responses. The statement added that SpaceX would review data to better understand the root cause of the misfire and noted the explosion happened after the loss of several engines. As always, success comes from what we learn, and todays flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starships reliability. The statement says debris should have fallen within a pre-planned area and the rocket did not contain any toxic materials. The company also included an email and phone number for those who believe theyve found any remnants of the craft. Musk has yet to comment on Thursdays explosion. The accident briefly halted flights at several Florida airports, including in Miami and Orlando, over concerns about flaming debris. A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the flights in and out of airports were delayed due to a space launch incident. The incident follows a test in January, which saw a Starship rocket fail minutes after launching from SpaceXs Texas facility. The FAA also briefly closed airports two months ago, due to the same concerns about falling debris. After Januarys incident, the FAA grounded Starship launches and noted the incident had led to property damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. Unfortunately this happened last time too, so we have some practice at this now, SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot told reporters at the launch site on Thursday. This latest Starship launch was conducted before the FAA finished investigating Januarys explosion, according to US media reports. A statement issued from the government of the Turks and Caicos said they were in contact with US authorities and SpaceX and would continue to keep the public apprised as we work to ensure the safety and security of our Islands. Footage posted on X purported to show flaming rocket debris falling over the Caribbean Sea. In the Bahamas, people posted that they were seeking shelter in order to take cover from debris.

Poundland could be put up for sale as taxes rise,"Poundlands owner has said it is considering putting the chain up for sale after warning tax changes coming in April will put more pressure on the business. The discount chain has 825 UK stores but sales were down this January and February, its Polish owner Pepco Group said. A rise in employer National Insurance (NI) contributions announced in the Budget start in April and Pepco says these will add further pressure to Poundlands costs. A host of High Street brands have warned of shop closures, job losses and price rises as a result of rising costs, but a government spokesperson said the chancellor had taken measures to support business, including capping the rate of corporation tax. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has previously defended the NI increase as the right decisions in the national interest. Pepco Group said Poundland was operating in an increasingly challenging UK retail landscape that is only intensifying. From April 2025, the UK governments additional tax changes announced in the Budget will also add further pressure to Poundlands cost base, it added. Retailers have been among the most vocal of businesses criticising the NI increase and the rise in the minimum wage, which will both happen in April. Tesco, Amazon, Greggs, Next and dozens of other chains last year wrote to the Treasury urging it reconsider some of the Budget measures. The government has defended the tax rise as necessary to avoid cuts to public services. The Pepco Group, which owns Pepco and Dealz stores in Europe, is making a profit so is looking at ways to separate itself from Poundland including a potential sale, it said. As part of the plans, former Poundland managing director Barry Williams, who took over as managing director of Pepco in September 2023, will return to his Poundland role. Stephan Borchert, chief executive of Pepco Group, told Reuters there are definitely interested parties for this business and said he was confident Poundlands future would be decided by September this year. Definitely were looking at all options but a sale is possibly a very good option since we believe that the business will do better with a new owner, he said. Pepco Group said its ultimate ambition is to operate under the single Pepco brand, focusing on its more profitable higher clothing and general merchandise ranges. It is also considering separating out the well-performing Dealz Poland.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg8jqw3wx9o,2025-03-08
Jack Daniel's maker says Canada taking bottles off shelves 'worse than tariffs',"Canadian provinces pulling US alcohol off store shelves in response to Trump trade policy is worse than tariffs, the boss of Jack Daniels maker Brown-Forman has said. Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario, which is by far the most populated, took action this week in retaliation for US tariffs on Canadian goods. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday. Brown-Forman boss Lawson Whiting said the Canadian response was disproportionate to the 25 levies on Canadian goods imposed by the Trump administration. I mean, thats worse than a tariff, because its literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves, Mr Whiting said. In response to the tariffs, Canada has retaliated with 25 levies on goods imported from the US, including beer, spirits, and wine. Some provinces also took action themselves, including Ontario and Nova Scotia. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly 1bn of US alcohol per year. As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves, Mr Ford said on Tuesday. The LCBO is the exclusive wholesaler in Ontario, which means other retailers, bars and restaurants in the province will no longer be able to restock US products, Mr Ford said. Nevertheless, Mr Whiting said Canada makes up only 1 of Brown-Formans total sales, so the firm can withstand the hit. Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Some Canadians have been turning to local goods anyway in response to the Trump tariffs. Canadas prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticised the US tariffs on Tuesday, saying imposing them was a very dumb thing to do. He also accused the US president of planning a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us. Trump has made a number of remarks about making Canada the 51st state of his country, which Canadas Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has said she takes very seriously. Washington has also placed 25 tariffs on Mexico, although Trump has said he will temporarily spare carmakers in both Canada and Mexico from the taxes. Trump has accused both Canada and Mexico of failing to do enough to stem the flow of the fentanyl opioid into the US, an argument that has been rejected by both countries. Mr Whiting said Brown-Forman was going to see what happens in Mexico, which accounted for 7 of its sales in 2024.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0422zzpw8o,2025-03-08
Worst train stations for cancellations named and shamed for first time,"Millions of passengers will see train cancellation and delay data published prominently at more than 1,700 railway stations in England from Thursday. The data will update every 28 days showing statistics for the most recent month in a bid to increase transparency and to hold operators to account. The government says performance information will appear on large digital display boards, with smaller stations displaying QR codes for passengers to scan on smartphones. Ince and Elton in Cheshire was the worst performing station for cancellations in the four weeks to 1 February, according to data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). The BBC understands that the data will not be announced audibly for people with print disabilities but the government says online data will be posted on a new portal which has been made accessible to screen reader users such as those who are blind and visually-impaired. The concept of publishing train reliability data is not new. The ORR publishes performance statistics which detail the percentage of services that are delayed or cancelled. Between 1 October and 31 December 2024, some 5.1 of train services were cancelled and only 62.1 of services were on time, according to the ORR. However, this is the first time that potentially embarrassing information is being proactively presented to millions of train passengers in England each day. And it is the first time the ORR is publishing monthly figures on the worst performing stations for the whole of England, Wales and Scotland. Though the data covers all three countries, the Department for Transport only has the power to display it in English stations. The devolved Welsh and Scottish transport departments currently have no plans to display the figures in their stations. The data also reveals how individual train operators are performing at each station. Train operators say cancellations are not always in their control and that the ORR data does not reflect cases when operators plug a gap in their services with another train. Source: Office of Rail and Road. Covers the period 5 January to 1 February As well as revealing the worst performers, the data also reveals that 33 stations of out of over 18,000 had no cancellations in the four-week period. Buckenham in Norfolk was the only station with a perfect score. It had no cancellations or unscheduled stops and all trains arrived on time or within three minutes, although only 100 trains stopped there in the month. Travellers in Reading were generally supportive of having the data on display in the station, though questioned what it would achieve. I think its a long time coming, said Charlotte from London. You need to have better communication. Rachel Alexander from Reading was keen to see the data display followed up with action. It would help if theyre doing something about it to have less cancellations and have more trains, she said. The move has been welcomed by the independent passenger watchdog, Transport Focus.

European Central Bank cuts interest rates again,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut interest rates for the sixth time in nine months as it seeks to bolster eurozone economic growth. The bank stuck to its plan to lower rates in the face of economic challenges, including threats of US tariffs and plans to boost European military spending. The ECB cut its main interest rate to 2.5 from 2.75, and once again reduced its forecasts for economic growth in the eurozone. The latest cut came as a sell-off of German government bonds spread to other bond markets, including the UK. The sell-off came after Germanys move this week to increase military and infrastructure spending. Political parties in talks to form a new government plan to pay for this by loosening Germanys fiscal rules, raising the prospect of a big increase in debt. In response, longer term German bonds saw their biggest sell-off in years on Wednesday. This pushed borrowing costs - as measured by the yields on the Germanys 10-year bonds - up by biggest daily amount since May 1997. On Thursday, German borrowing costs - as measured by the yields on the countrys bonds - continued to rise. Yields continued to rise on Thursday, hitting 2.929 at one point - the highest level since October 2023. The increase has had a knock-on effect on other countries, with UK borrowing costs also increasing. UK government borrowing costs have already risen due to concerns about persistent inflation and interest rates not coming down as quickly as previously thought. However, Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilters, said the market was still expecting the Bank of England to make two further rate cuts in 2025, with recent inflation data reasonably encouraging. With inflation getting closer to its 2 target, the ECB said its interest rate cuts were making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. But it trimmed its prediction for eurozone growth, putting expansion in 2025 at just 0.9, only slightly above the 0.7 pace recorded last year. The ECB faces a number of upcoming challenges as it tries to get inflation to its 2 target. The eurozone economy may suffer if the Trump administration goes ahead with plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes US imports.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30mz648nyno,2025-03-08
Are Scottish students using AI to cheat their way to a degree?,"More than 600 Scottish students were accused of misusing AI during part of their studies last year - a rise of 121 on 2023 figures. According to a freedom of information request by BBC Scotland, less than 10 students were kicked off their courses at both Robert Gordon and Glasgow universities in the last year - the first time AI-linked expulsions have been recorded at any Scottish university. So when does turning to the internet to help find the answer to a question cross the line into cheating? Thats the big issue facing Scottish universities, as day-to-day reliance on generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as Chat GPT, becomes the norm. Dylan Walch is an education advisor with the University of Edinburghs Students Association and said the number of staff and students seeking advice around the use of AI was on the rise. He says students who are already using AI often come to the association to seek clarity around its use, while a minority have been caught misusing it. He told BBC Scotland News that low-level cases would prompt a discussion with a lecturer which might lead to a small mark deduction, but in more severe cases the university would interview the student in front of a panel. It can be quite intimidating and quite a big procedure and they can lose anywhere from 10 to 50 marks, he said. Scotland has a student population of 292,240. Figures among AI misuse remain low, but academics say it poses a real challenge around keeping the grading process fair. Prof Sian Bayne is leading the research around the use of AI in higher education at the University of Edinburgh and says it is a complex debate. The most high-profile concern has been around misconduct and cheating in assessments by generating essays and coursework, she said. I think one of my main concerns is theres increasing research which shows that it enables a cognitive offloading, instead of reading a complex text and analysing it, its much easier to put a complex text into generative AI and get that generative AI to do that complex work for them. Only two universities in Scotland, Robert Gordon and Abertay, have dedicated software to help detect the misuse of AI, yet misuse rates remain higher at other universities - with Stirling recording the highest level at 262 cases in the last year. Some institutions are thinking about investing in generative AI detection software, Prof Bayne said. She said lecturers were pretty good at spotting work turned in using AI, but warned that would become more difficult as the technology evolved. She said: At the moment we are thinking about ways which we can redesign assessment so that were using more multi-model methods like images, audio and video or more oral assessments or more in-person exams, as other ways of protecting against that kind of misconduct. BBC Scotland News met a group of Edinburgh university students who argue that AI serves them more as a tool than a shortcut when it comes to their learning.

Denmark postal service to stop delivering letters,"Denmarks state-run postal service, PostNord, is to end all letter deliveries at the end of 2025, citing a 90 decline in letter volumes since the start of the century. The decision brings to an end 400 years of the companys letter service. Denmarks 1,500 post boxes will start to disappear from the start of June. Transport Minister Thomas Danielsen sought to reassure Danes, saying letters would still be sent and received as there is a free market for both letters and parcels. Postal services across Europe are grappling with the decline in letter volumes. Germanys Deutsche Post said on Thursday it was axing 8,000 jobs, in what it called a socially responsible manner. Deutsche Post has 187,000 employees and staff representatives said they feared more cuts were to come. Denmark had a universal postal service for 400 years until the end of 2023, but as digital mail services have taken hold, the use of letters has fallen dramatically. PostNord says it will switch its focus to parcel deliveries and that any postage stamps bought this year or in 2024 can be refunded for a limited period in 2026. Fifteen hundred workers face losing their jobs, out of a workforce of 4,600. Its a super sad day. Not just for our department, but for the 1,500 who face an uncertain future, employee Anders Raun Mikkelsen told Danish broadcaster DR. Denmark ranks as one of the worlds most digitalised countries. Theres an app for almost everything: few people use cash, and Danes even carry drivers licences and health cards on their smartphones. Bank statements, bills, and correspondence from local authorities are all sent electronically. Public services send communications via a Digital Post app or other platforms and PostNord Denmark says the letter market is no longer profitable. Letter numbers have fallen since the start of the century from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year. The decision will affect elderly people most. Although 95 of Danes use the Digital Post service, a reported 271,000 people still rely on physical mail. There are many who are very dependent on letters being delivered regularly. These include hospital appointments, vaccinations or decisions regarding home care, Marlene Rishoj Cordes, from Aeldre Sagen (DaneAge) told Denmarks TV2. PostNord has weathered years of financial struggles and last year was running a deficit. Danish MP Pelle Dragsted blamed privatisation for the move and complained the move would disadvantage people living in remote areas. The introduction of a new Postal Act in 2024 opened up the letter market to competition from private firms and mail is no longer exempted from VAT, resulting in higher postage costs. When a letter costs 29 Danish krone (3.35; 4.20) there will be fewer letters, PostNord Denmarks Managing Director, Kim Pedersen, told local media. He said Danes had become increasingly digital and the decline in letter volumes had become so pronounced that it had fallen by as much as 30 in the past year alone. PostNord also operates...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg8jllq283o,2025-03-08
Banks to pay customers millions after month's worth of IT outages,"Nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years, figures published by a group of MPs show. The Treasury Committee - which has been investigating the impact of banking IT failures - compelled Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to provide the data. It does not include the Barclays outage in January or the Lloyds outage last week - two incidents which occurred on payday for many people, and left customers unable to pay their staff and bills. The report finds Barclays could now face compensation payments of 12.5m. For families and individuals living pay cheque to pay cheque, losing access to banking services on payday can be a terrifying experience, said Dame Meg Hillier, the committees chair. The fact there has been enough outages to fill a whole month within the last two years shows customers frustrations are completely valid, she added. Speaking on the BBCs Today programme, she said she hoped putting the data in the public domain would encourage banks and the regulator to see if there was any more that could be done to reduce the disruption. The Treasury said it was grateful to see the Committees findings. A spokesperson told the BBC that the Treasury is working with the financial authorities to regulate third party suppliers, as well as considering whether the banks are doing all they can to provide the level of service customers expect. But Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, says the findings once again highlights that the traditional banking sector hasnt kept pace with the investment needed to modernise its infrastructure. The findings come as hundreds of Santander customers reported issues affecting access to the banks app and physical banking services on Thursday afternoon. Were aware that customers are currently unable to access some of our services, the company has told customers visiting its websites service status dashboard. Were very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing, and we are working hard to fix the problem as soon as possible. The Treasury Committee data looked at IT failures which affected millions of customers between January 2023 and February this year. They found there had been 158 incidents. While the data does not include the Barclays outage in January, which left one family without a home, the bank told the committee that over half of online payments over the course of the first day of the outage did not work due to severe degradation of their systems performance. That family was Emily McAllister, from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, and her children. Ms McAllister and her 19-year-old daughter Keira, who is autistic and has Downs syndrome, had to spend two nights with her sister and one night at a local hotel after their house move was delayed due to the Barclays outage. Speaking after the committee released its re...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd3yzx3xgvo,2025-03-08
Carmakers win break from Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico,"US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare carmakers from a new 25 import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect. The announcement by the White House came even as Trump continued to blast Canada for not doing enough to stop drugs from entering the US. Nothing has convinced me that it has stopped, Trump wrote on social media after a phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the economic disruption caused by new trade tariffs. News of the relief helped to boost US shares, which closed higher after two days of declines that had wiped out gains the SP 500 had seen since the presidential election in November. The tariff exemption is for cars made in North America that comply with the continents existing free trade agreement. That deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had backed a one-month exemption to the tariffs for the car industry after pleas from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which have supply chains that stretch across North America. The new tariffs - which are a tax applied as goods enter the country - were poised to disrupt a third of car production in North America within a week, according to analysts at SP Global Mobility. Shares in Ford were up by more than 5 after the announcement, while General Motors shares rose more than 7. Stellantis shares in the US rose more than 9. The president is open to hearing about additional exemptions, Ms Leavitt added. He always has open dialogue and hell always do what he believes is right for the American people. Ford said in a statement the company will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration and touted its investment of billions in the United States. Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that affordability would be hurt and business relationships would suffer, despite the chances for targeted relief. Weve seen this movie before. President Trump puts tariffs in place and then doles out exemptions one at a time, said Matthew Holmes, the organisations chief of public policy. That is not how a long-lasting trade alliance is built. Ontario Premier Doug Ford told Canadian media that the one-month reprieve for automakers would not alter his plans for retaliation, which have already included a halt to sales of US liquor in the province. Trumps moves, and his threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world, have raised fears of a wider trade war. As well as Mexico and Canada, he hit goods from China with an additional tariff on Tuesday, raising levies to at least 20 and prompting the country to retaliate against US exports, including agricultural products. Canada also responded with its o...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zn47d5j1o,2025-03-08
Warning people in UK could have less money due to US tariffs,"US president Donald Trumps tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers pockets, the governor of the Bank of England has warned. Tariffs could hit growth and pose substantial risks to the UK and world economies, Andrew Bailey told MPs. Other Bank experts also said trade frictions could hurt companies in the UK and elsewhere. Mr Bailey urged for trade disputes to be settled globally, and stressed the importance of trade. The US has been ratcheting up trade tensions, and this week imposed new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and doubled the levy recently put on Chinese goods. Speaking to MPs about the effects of Trump tariffs, Mr Bailey said: The risks to the UK economy, and indeed the world economy, are substantial. When asked whether Trump tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers pockets, Mr Bailey said Yes. We serve the people, and we have to take it very seriously. Megan Greene, a member of the Banks monetary policy committee, said there is a lack of certainty about how far the US will go in implementing tariffs, and about how countries will respond. But tariffs could affect the UK economy in a number of ways, she said. If there are tariffs imposed on UK goods going into the US, this would put downward pressure on the UK economy, because firms would find it harder to sell to US consumers. But that could also lower inflation, the pace at which prices rise. If supply chains fragmented and had to be reordered this would hit UK growth and push up inflation. Ultimately, tariffs would push down on growth, Greene said, adding that there was a tonne of uncertainty about how Trumps tariffs would play out, but there would probably be more negatives for UK the economic activity than positives. Professor Alan Taylor, who is also a monetary policy committee member, agreed the risks to the economy outweigh the upsides, and that is true for people around the country and around the world. He added: If you put sand in those wheels of trade were going to be worse off on some margin. Mr Bailey said he agreed very strongly with the assessment of the committee members. Trade supports growth. Openness supports the spread of innovation and ideas, he said. Bailey called for trade disputes to be settled via the World Trade Organization, rather than thrashed out between the US and other countries. Mr Trump and his administration have said higher tariffs on goods imported into the US will help it get better deals with allies and rivals around the world. But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world. Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises. Some of Trumps allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing. Bailey said the move would be a very damaging thing for the world...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdelzez04z5o,2025-03-08
Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed,"Ministers, facing potential cuts of billions of pounds from the welfare budget, have announced plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work. The coaches are already employed by job centres but will be redeployed to focus on tackling economic inactivity, said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). It said the staff would provide personalised and intensive support to thousands of sick and disabled people. But the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on people on low incomes, said only a tiny percentage would actually find a job. The coaches will offer tailored employment support to people on health-related benefits and help them access support with writing CVs and interview techniques, the government said. Ministers hope moving thousands of people into jobs will help them unlock the benefits of work and cut the rapidly rising cost of health and disability benefits. But the Resolution Foundation said only about 3 of the hundreds of thousands of people likely to lose benefit payments were likely to find a job. In a report called Delivering the Undeliverable, the researchers argue the causes of the rising welfare costs include the country getting older and sicker and that while ministers are keen on quick financial cuts, truly effective reforms will take time to deliver. The government described the 1,000 redeployed work coaches as a downpayment on plans to overhaul employment support, set to be unveiled within weeks. The current system fails to intervene early enough to stop people becoming unemployed and misses opportunities to support their return, the DWP said. It has become defined by poor experiences and low trust among many people who use it, it added. Some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness, the department said. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase on the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the broken welfare system Labour had inherited was failing sick and disabled people, is bad for the taxpayer, and holding the economy back. For too long, sick, and disabled people have been told they cant work, denied support, and locked out of jobs, with all the benefits that good work brings, she said. But many sick and disabled people want and can work, with the right support. Selected figures published from a survey for the government suggest 44 of disabled people and those with a health condition in the UK do not trust the DWP to help people reach their full career potential. The same proportion believe DWP does not provide enough support to those out of work because of disability, ill health or a long-term health condition, according to the survey. Some...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2898n721yo,2025-03-08
US charges Chinese hackers who targeted dissidents,"US prosecutors have charged 12 Chinese nationals for being part of an alleged hacking scheme, which sold data of US-based dissidents to the Chinese government. The state-sponsored operation also targeted government agencies including the Treasury, according to the Justice Department (DOJ). Hackers also allegedly targeted an American religious organisation, and a newspaper in Hong Kong, the statement added. China has not responded to these specific allegations, but have strongly denied other accusations in the past. In December, the Treasury Department reported a major breach by Chinese -sponsored hackers, saying they were able to access employee workstations and some unclassified documents. At that time, China denied any involvement, calling the accusation baseless and saying it consistently opposes all forms of hacking. It is unclear when the latest DOJ charges were issued - but they were unsealed in a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday. Among the individuals charged were two officers of Chinas Ministry of Public Security. The DOJ said that hackers, which appeared to represent a private company, i-Soon, charged Chinese agencies between 10,000 and 75,000 for each exploited email inbox. They allegedly conducted computer intrusions under the direction of Chinese ministries and on their own initiative, and were paid handsomely for stolen data. Today, we are exposing the Chinese government agents directing and fostering indiscriminate and reckless attacks against computers and networks worldwide, said Sue J Bai, who heads the DOJs National Security Division. We will continue to fight to dismantle this ecosystem of cyber mercenaries and protect our national security, she added. No further details on the targeted US-based dissidents were provided. The religious organisation hit by hackers was described as one which previously sent missionaries to China and was openly critical of the PRC government. PRC is short for the Peoples Republic of China. A Hong Kong newspaper was also on the list. While it was not named, the statement said that it was considered as being opposed to the PRC government. Besides US agencies, hackers were said to have targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea and Indonesia. Last October, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said hacks targeting two major US presidential campaigns were carried out by actors affiliated with the Peoples Republic of China. Earlier last year, seven Chinese nationals were charged with running a hacking operation that lasted at least 14 years and targeted foreign critics of China. Operations linked by Western governments to China have also targeted the UKs Electoral Commission, and the UK and New Zealand parliaments. As part of its long-running rewards programme, the US State Department said it was offering up to 10m for information on i-Soon, its employees and Chinese officials engaged in malicious cyber activities highlighted in the Department of Just...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4nw84dzr8o,2025-03-08
Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions,"The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the governments official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellors financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said the world has changed since Rachel Reevess Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had 9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. The OBRs forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK. The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its major measures -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellors self-imposed rules on borrowing money. The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending. Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are non-negotiable. The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March. The Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes, a government insider told the BBC. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellors response later this month. Insiders expect politically painful new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4s Today programme there had been a huge rise in the welfare budget and there were too many young people not in work, education or training. Theres a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and theres a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable, she added. Reeves has previously pledged fundamental reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election. Some of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives which encourag...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lpjqg2mp5o,2025-03-08
Co-op admits unlawfully blocking rival store openings,"The Co-op has admitted breaching rules to prevent rival supermarkets from opening nearby more than 100 times. The UKs competition watchdog found Co-op had breached an order which limits supermarkets ability to prevent nearby land being used by rival retailers across England, Scotland and Wales. Blocking other grocers from opening nearby hits competition between supermarkets and means shoppers have less choice when trying to get cheaper prices, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said. A spokesperson for Co-op said: This is a matter we take very seriously, and we have taken all necessary action to ensure this issue is resolved and does not happen again. The Co-op admitted 107 breaches of the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010. It has re-written 104 agreements and agreed to resolve three others, the CMA said. It released a list of the 107 locations and in an open letter to the Co-op, the CMA said it was concerned by the very large number of breaches. The Co-ops spokesperson added: As a business that is committed to operating fairly, we recognise this is extremely disappointing. The Co-op owns almost 2,400 stores across the UK and holds a 5.2 market share in the UKs 190.9bn supermarket industry, according to the CMA. The chain said the number of breaches amounted to less than 2 of transactions across its property portfolio, which includes its supermarkets and funeral directors. Many of the UKs biggest supermarkets have also breached the land order in recent years, but not to the extent that Co-op was found to in the CMAs latest action. Last year Morrisons had the highest number of breaches of the order at 55. The order bans new restrictive covenants which prohibit land being used for a supermarket. It also bans exclusivity arrangements which prevent landlords from allowing stores to compete with an existing supermarket which were over five years long. Daniel Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA said: Restrictive agreements by our leading retailers affect competition between supermarkets and impact shoppers trying to get the best deals. Lee Tiso, 57, from Scotland said the lack of choice where he lives means he struggles to shop around to save money. He said: I live in Lochgilphead, which is a remote area of the Argyll. Co-op and Tesco have small stores here. The nearest Aldi and Lidl are 40 miles away in Oban and the nearest Poundland or Home Bargains is on the outskirts of Glasgow and 68 miles away. We are forced to pay whatever Co-op charges. Its a similar issue for Maureen Loftus who moved to the Isle of Skye in Scotland. She said the only stores nearby are a Co-op supermarket, a Co-op convenience store and a Spar. I dont know why other supermarkets arent here considering the consumer demand? she said. She added Tesco, Asda and Morrisons make daily deliveries to a small number of click and collect points on the island - but the slots are so in demand that to get an easy slot she has to travel to another...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2gwwnd0wo,2025-03-08
UK competition watchdog drops Microsoft-OpenAI probe,"The UK competition watchdog has ended its investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was looking into whether Microsofts relationship with what is the worlds best known artificial intelligence (AI) firm changed after the turmoil which saw its boss Sam Altman fired and then rehired. The CMA has concluded that, despite Microsoft investing billions of dollars into OpenAI and having exclusive uses of some of its AI products, the partnership remains the same, so is not subject to review under the UKs merger rules. Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been defanged. The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked. In view of Microsofts potentially important role in securing Sam Altmans re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAIs commercial policy, the watchdog said. But on Wednesday, it concluded Microsoft exerts a high level of material influence over OpenAIs commercial policy without fully controlling it. Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UKs merger control regime, CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn. But he added: The CMAs findings on jurisdiction should not be read as the partnership being given a clean bill of health on potential competition concerns; but the UK merger control regime must of course operate within the remit set down by Parliament. Critics though say the decision is linked to the changed political environment the CMA is now operating in. The government has instructed the countrys regulators to suggest ways of stimulating economic growth. In January, the government removed the then chair of the CMA, Marcus Bokkerink, because it was unhappy with his response to that call. He was replaced on an interim basis by Doug Gurr, former boss of Amazon UK. The CMA has sat on this decision for over a year, yet within just a few weeks of a former Amazon boss being installed as chair, it has decided everything was absolutely fine all along, nothing to see here, said Foxglove co-executive director Rosa Curling. This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech  just like they did the last one, she told the BBC. When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamfords LinkedIn post, where he said: We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment. He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and Ope...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd87dxezvo,2025-03-08
Sweden is 'no longer a country that cannot be trusted',"War, cross-border conflict and geopolitical upheaval are rarely deemed good for business. Yet that appears to have been the impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine on two of the aggressors neighbours to its west  Finland and Sweden. Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations response to the invasion that turned fear into hope. Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion. Less than three years later, theyre both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics. Were no longer a country that cannot be trusted, observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nations previous historic neutrality. He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Natos ordering from defence firms. Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into whats going on inside the alliance. We couldnt access NSPAs before, he says. Jukka Siukosaari, Finlands Ambassador to the UK, agrees. Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond. Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending. Presently, only 23 of the organisations 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2 of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance. Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA. Natos newest members spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4 and Sweden 2.2 of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6 and 3 in the next three years. Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europes northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland. Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finlands, Swedens, Norways and Denmarks 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence. In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out. And while the White House this week announced a pause in US military aid to Ukraine, European leaders have declared theyre in it for the long haul, so here too we can expect substantial and ongoi...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjyxljyjxno,2025-03-08
Why detecting methane is difficult but crucial work,"In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is. Theyre armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies. But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen. Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes. A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma. Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation. Its very heartbreaking and alarming when youre doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they cant change for now, Ms Bah says. Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas. While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation. Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture. But methane is not always easy to notice. It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light. Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful. There is no perfect solution, says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative. There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities. Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says. At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms. Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions. He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger fi...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w51kg8ldo,2025-03-08
Diversity backlash: Is 'masculine energy' coming to the UK?,"Dangerous, demeaning, and immoral. Thats how Donald Trump has described diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes which aim to boost workers from diverse backgrounds. Upon returning to the White House, he ordered the shutdown of all federal DEI initiatives, urging the private sector to follow suit. And many have, with the likes of Walmart, McDonalds, Meta and Amazon ditching or scaling back their diversity policies. Corporations, according to Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, have been neutered and need more masculine energy. Some UK employees fear Trumps rhetoric could normalise intolerant attitudes in the workplace, even if DEI policies remain intact. Someone that is at the top saying things like that sets a precedent that its okay to do so, says Chloe, who works at a London-based finance company. Stefan Hoops, the head of Deutsche Banks investment arm, also said he feared Trumps language would lead us straight back to the macho Wolf of Wall Street era and called on companies to ensure equal opportunities. He posted his thoughts on LinkedIn alongside a picture of him lifting weights, saying, I figured a masculine-looking picture would balance my anti-anti-woke observations. But so far there is little evidence of UK firms changing their diversity policies. In fact, the UK arm of accountancy giant Deloitte has signalled a split with its US counterpart by saying it remains committed to our diversity goals, not long after staff in the US were told there were plans to sunset their DEI goals. In the UK, the Equality Act protects against discrimination and since 2017, organisations with over 250 employees must report their gender pay gap. In addition, any company listed on the stock exchange is required to publish board diversity data against set targets, including that at least 40 of board members should be women. Pavita Cooper is the UK chair of the 30 Club, which campaigns to increase gender diversity in senior management. She says the UKs legal system will help protect DEI policies. In the US, they are talking a lot about affirmative action and woke ideology. In the UK, we focus a lot more on positive action, Ms Cooper says. She explains that affirmative action involves quotas, while positive action encourages participation without preferential treatment, such as through scholarships or mentoring. Martha Lane Fox, who has worked to promote diversity in the tech sector, believes the UK has an opportunity to lean into diversity - stand apart from the US. She points out the irony of Elon Musk, tasked by Donald Trump with slashing federal government spending, standing in the Oval Office with his young son as he dismantled DEI programmes. Imagine if everyone had such casual and extraordinary opportunities for childcare, what could we unlock? However, Baroness Lane Fox, who is chair of the British Chambers of Commerce business group, says the UK still has a long way to go in terms of representation, pointing out that there is only one disabled person o...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2365p3m4ko,2025-03-08
Switzerland targets rich tourists but at what cost?,"The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy. Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too. So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, its an opportunity. In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists. Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guests wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer ski butlers to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots. Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend. But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures. Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8 of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25 of Switzerlands total revenue from tourism. The numbers speak for themselves, says Mr Berger. The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests. Whats more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong. Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices, Mr Berger explains. There is always somewhere cheaper. Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts. But its not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerlands most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market. A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hun...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yy09we1eo,2025-03-08
Can AI help modernise Ireland's healthcare system?,"For a country famous as Big Techs European address, Irelands hospitals often lag far behind in technology. They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics. In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublins Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its AE. Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health systems entire computer network, and published 520 peoples medical records online. But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare. That includes a programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its 22.9bn (20bn; 24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UKs or Canadas. To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved. Its a problem being tackled at Dublins Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Irelands busiest emergency department. Thats especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish AE departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen. In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI magnetic resonance imaging or CT computed tomography scans, says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater. Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment. To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures. The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they dont have experienced consultants to turn to. Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isnt alone, theyve got a wing man, he says. Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges. Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends. Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin. But now, Prof MacMahon and the Maters AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a synthetic MRI from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries. That was done by feeding a generative AI model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person. Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments. And since radiology scans also come with doctors text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends. Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the countr...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7yxm3py5o,2025-03-08
Countries compete to keep skilled young workers,"In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsofts Dublin subsidiary. A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsofts headquarters in Seattle, where he still works. Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career. Mr Diass decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving. The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous. I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldnt be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level, says. A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbons Instituto Superior Técnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to 35,000 (36,000; 29,000). But his take home salary was much, much less. His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40 of this gross salary went to the state. Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didnt live with my parents, he recalls. Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to 60,000. The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of 160,000 before a 20 income tax rate, much lower than at home. Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years time with with many more savings. Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments. In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Partys Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education. In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data. After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels. The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance. But specialists say it likely wont be enough to keep the young from going abroad. It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under 28,000, says Sérgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Católica Lisbon School of Law. He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average workers salary than most richer nations.

What minerals does Ukraine have and what are they used for?,"Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign a deal with the US on the joint development of his countrys mineral deposits at any time and in any convenient format. It comes days after an acrimonious visit to Washington, during which Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance in front of journalists and TV cameras. The deal was supposed to be signed during that visit, but was put on hold as the Ukrainian president left the White House early. Days later, in a social media statement which came hours after the US paused all military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky expressed his gratitude over American support for Ukraine and said he was ready to sign the deal. Trump said he appreciated the message, although it is not clear if or when the deal will be signed. Kyiv estimates that about 5 of the worlds critical raw materials are in Ukraine. This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation one of the top five leading countries for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles. Ukraine has 7 of Europes supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations. It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors. Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant. Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world. Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraines economy minister, resources worth 350bn (277bn) remain in occupied territories today. In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63 of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits. Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a strategic and economic dimension in Russias continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains. Critical minerals are the foundation of the 21st Century economy, Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics, he said. Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraines mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75 of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group. In December, China banned th...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20le8jn282o,2025-03-08
Can Canadians get the world drinking tree sap?,"While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world. We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes. What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2 natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet. A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes. People feel like theyre drinking the wild Canadian forest, says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City. Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product  coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts. As Canada is far and away the worlds largest producer of maple syrup  accounting for more than 80 of production  it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90 of Canadas maple syrup. Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. Nobody previously thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup. He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner Stéphane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace. Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75 of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings. Its more than just a local product at this point, adds Mr Leclerc. For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled 506m (409m), with that expected to jump to 2.6bn by 2033. By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached 7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to 22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up. Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was 1.7bn last year, according to one study. Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits. When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants, she says. So theyre gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery. However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water wa...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde98k6e2dno,2025-03-08
Will quantum computers disrupt critical infrastructure?,"Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky. Much to everyones relief the impact turned out to be minimal. Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the worlds digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated. Thats because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack. Quantum computing is radically different to the classical computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states  one or zero, on or off  quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions. The reason why its so powerful is because youre doing all those possible computations simultaneously, Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means its much, much more efficient, much, much more powerful. This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems. The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across todays computer networks. Todays computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes. This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. Anything thats protected by something thats vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers, says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2. Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away. But progress is being made. In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key breakthroughs and paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer. Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Todays systems have a few hundred at most. But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices. Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, What data in your organization is valuable for that period of time? ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq9zxxn72qo,2025-03-08
Georgia's richest man said to be moving funds to avoid US sanctions,"Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the countrys politics, Georgias parliament rushed through amendments to the nations tax code. Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change  which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia  may have been introduced to serve the interests of the countrys richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. He is the founder and honorary chairman of the countrys ruling party, Georgian Dream. Now it is clear, those changes were made for him, says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze. With an estimated wealth of 4.9bn (3.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies. Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the countrys MPs passed the contentious transparency on foreign influence bill, often dubbed the foreign agents law. Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20 of their funding from abroad have to register as organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power, submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country. Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police. In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year. There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili. The motion expressed deep concern at the suspension of Georgias EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters. TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. All his big business, which he has in Georgia, in the hospitality sector, in the energy sector, all the parent companies of these Georgian companies, the last beneficiaries are registered in these so-called offshore territories, says Beso Namchavadze. He adds that TI Georgia believes that Mr Ivanishvili and other family members are continuing to transfer ownership of companies they previously controlled through offshore entities to newly established firms in Georgia.

Hair: 'It’s just thrown away but it's gold',"Zeeshan Ali has been a drag artist for 10 years and has taken his show all over India. Central to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs. Its an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage, says Ali, who is based in Mumbai. But getting that look right wasnt easy in the early days. When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric, he says. But things are different now. The trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. Its no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement. Indian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the worlds biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85 of global demand. Kolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish. My parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same, he says. Hair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair. It requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value. Its just thrown away but its gold, says Mr Venkatesh. Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and 1 (0.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair. Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices. For the individual picker, theres not much money in it. A diligent collector might gather 15 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to 6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas, says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him. While our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices. Most of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs. China has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars, says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government. If India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do. When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up, Mr Cherian says. He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry. It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated ha...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dl93l7w2go,2025-03-08
Scientists work on 'superhuman' vision systems for robots,"If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, youre going to need some smoke. But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot. Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off. The whole building got triggered, says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. My student called me. He was very surprised. The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system. Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain  or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons. But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors. However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves. Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather. But the spinning array on Prof Zhaos robot throws radio waves in all directions. An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information. What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision  to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot, explains Prof Zhao. He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building. Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms. Although humans cant see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light. Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections. The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles. Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light. Its really very interesting work and quite impressive, says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms. One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2l1y73mz1o,2025-03-08
Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?,"Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans dont buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe? Italys ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans dont take our cars. Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. Ive done it, and its very difficult. Add cost to the question, and it becomes obvious why you dont see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers  Traders, which represents the industry in the UK. We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles. Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. They pay per gallon what we pay per litre, he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon. Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others. In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth 36bn (37bn; 30bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for 5.2bn. This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump. Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal, explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EUs 10 tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5 tariffs the US  currently - charges on cars imported from the EU. These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25 import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers. Trumps move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europes automotive industry from a potential trade war. Trumps intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. So far what weve been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos, NBC News recently reported him as saying. In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. If you can help it, you dont want to ship cars around the world. Theyre big boxes of expensive air, he says.

As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8kn5v37wxo,2025-03-08
Erasing Escobar: Will Colombia ban the sale of memorabilia of the drug lord?,"A proposed law in Colombias Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose cocaine cartel has been linked to thousands of murders. One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news. His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning. I remember leaving and seeing my mum and grandma waiting for me, crying, says Mr Rojas, who was just 10-years-old at the time. It was a very, very sad day. Minutes after take off, an explosion on board Avianca flight 203 killed the 107 passengers and crew, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris. The blast wasnt an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medellín cartel. While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombias past, Escobars legacy has not. The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos. In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors. But a proposed law in Colombias Congress is seeking to change this. The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings. Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner, says Juan Sebastián Gómez, Congress member and co-author of the bill. The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses. Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods. This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well, says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medellín. Medellín, Escobars hometown, was known as the most dangerous city in the world in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombias armed conflict. Today its been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar. This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids, says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.

Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?,"For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germanys industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the countrys famous post-war economic miracle. Its Big Three brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery? When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europes biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away. Wolfsburg is Germanys answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you dont work in the factory yourself, its certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school. Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - its kind of a synonym, explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Groups in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus  a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry. Were proud of the plant, he says. It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle. Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the countrys economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy  and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role. Car-making makes up about a fifth of the countrys manufacturing ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6pzwj6qq7o,2025-03-08
Why do kindness influencers get criticised?,"Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied. The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message. It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile, says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia. The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell. I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit, he says. Kindness content creators, or influencers as theyre often called, are increasing in numbers on social media. Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut. Kindness is cool, says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers. Mr Dereniowskis videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money. I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story and often the people who have the least give the most, says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers. Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brands product. The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular? Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments. Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content. On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism? While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives, says Ms Cleary. Others go furth...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23v3kxknrno,2025-03-08
Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?,"President Trumps sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as weve seen - be used as a bargaining chip. The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25 duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25 tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We dont yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade. Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and  amidst the inevitable retaliation - backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era? I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trumps policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers. Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people. Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as the most beautiful word in the dictionary - which is really intriguing. Whats the attraction for him? Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a beautiful thing for several reasons. Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of 1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and weve seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days. Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years. He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs. DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trumps economic goals? JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than weve seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards. Five hundred years of history shows that the e...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzp7j84yro,2025-03-08
How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe,"Its a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the citys Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies. Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovias historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid. There was a moment during Covid when I thought maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before, says Elena Mirón, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city. But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. Im happy, because I can live off this job I love. Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the worlds biggest foreign tourist hub. And the tourism industrys post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozones fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2 last year. By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2 in 2024, while France grew by 1.1, Italy by 0.5, and the UK by an expected 0.9. This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the worlds best-performing economy. The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth, says Carlos Cuerpo, the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40 of eurozone growth last year. Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11 in one year. We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth, he adds. That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EUs Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to 163bn by 2026 (169bn; 136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy. Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses. Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic, says María Jesús Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spains IESE Business School. Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade p...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7jmlyx02o,2025-03-08
Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook,"President Trump inherited an economy that was, by most conventional measures, firing on all cylinders. Wages, consumer spending and corporate profits were rising. Unemployment was low. The inflation rate, though higher than normal, was falling. Just weeks into Mr. Trumps term, the outlook is gloomier. Measures of business and consumer confidence have plunged. The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Layoffs are picking up, according to some data. And forecasters are cutting their estimates for economic growth this year, with some even predicting that the U.S. gross domestic product could shrink in the first quarter. Some commentators have gone further, arguing that the economy could be headed for a recession, a sharp rebound in inflation or even the dreaded combination of the two, stagflation. Most economists consider that unlikely, saying growth is more likely to slow than to give way to a decline. Still, the sudden deterioration in the outlook is striking, especially because it is almost entirely a result of Mr. Trumps policies and the resulting uncertainty. Tariffs, and the inevitable retaliation from trading partners, will increase prices and slow down growth. Federal job cuts will push up unemployment, and could lead government employees and contractors to pull back on spending while they wait to learn their fate. Deportations could drive up costs for industries like construction and hospitality that depend on immigrant labor. If the economy was starting out in quite good shape, its probably in less good shape after what weve seen the last few weeks, said Donald Rissmiller, chief economist at Strategas, a research firm. The U.S. economy has repeatedly shown its resilience in recent years, and there are parts of Mr. Trumps agenda that could foster growth. Business groups have responded enthusiastically to Republican plans to cut taxes and reduce regulation. A streamlined government could, in theory, make the overall economy more productive.

Stock Market Has Worst Weekly Drop in Months as Tariffs Hang Over Wall St.,"The stock market suffered its worst week in many months, after a series of dizzying policy shifts on tariffs from the White House and simmering concerns about the health of the economy. The SP 500 seesawed throughout the day on Friday, marking a volatile end to a turbulent week, as investors parsed the latest employment data and comments from the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, about the direction of interest rates. Even though the index ended the day with a gain, the SP 500 notched its third consecutive week of losses with a drop of 3.1 percent, its sharpest weekly decline since early September. There has been a sharp mood shift since the index hit a record high less than a month ago, as investors have become worried about the trajectory for economic growth, made worse by tariffs on imports from the countrys largest trading partners. Surveys have also showed mounting concern among consumers. On Friday, investors appeared to take solace from Mr. Powells comments after he struck a positive tone, saying despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to be in a good place. He reiterated the Feds commitment to keep rates steady as it works to bring down inflation. Another positive sign on Friday came from the labor market. With 151,000 jobs added in February, the data showed a pace of hiring moderate enough to temper fears about resurgent inflation, yet robust enough to avoid exacerbating worries about a slowing economy. Lara Castleton, U.S. head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, said the jobs data would probably ease overly sour expectations about the economy. After confidence on the economy has taken a turn, she said, market participants were looking to either confirm or reverse that sentiment. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

U.S. Hiring Holds Steady,"U.S. Economy Employers added 151,000 jobs in February, up from 143,000 in January. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1 percent. Monthly change in jobs 0 100,000 200,000 300,000 Feb.24 March April May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. Jan.25 Feb. 151,000 jobs in February Note: Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Karl Russell Talmon Joseph Smith It could be the calm before a storm, or it may be business as usual. U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in February, the first full month under the new Trump administration, extending a streak of job growth to 50 months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent, from 4 percent. Is DOGE playing a role? The survey showed a decline of 10,000 in federal employment. But the report was based on surveys conducted in the second week of February, and economists say the administrations mass firings, buyouts and hiring freezes at federal agencies may not fully surface in the monthly data until sometime this spring. What about tariffs? A similar wait is in store for those hoping to ascertain the effects that President Trumps tariffs  both those imposed and those still threatened  may have on global trading partners, business investment and employment. Zooming out: Even without the shake-up in foreign trade and federal employment, private-sector hiring has slowed substantially from the blowout pace of 2021 to 2023. That has left labor market analysts and financial commentators gearing up for a potential cooling in economic growth this year. Context: For now, unemployment continues to glide just above record lows. And gains in average hourly earnings for workers have kept up a solid pace, overtaking inflation since mid-2023. What theyre saying: The stock market reacted to the report positively, as did most economists. This is a fundamentally healthy labor market, continuing its earlier momentum, albeit at a slightly slower pace, said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan. A detox period: In an interview Friday morning with CNBC before the release of the data, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asserted that financial markets and the economy overall had become too reliant on government spending and there is going to be a detox period going forward, prompted by Trump administration cutbacks. Other Trump advisers, including Elon Musk, have also issued such warnings. Could we be seeing that this economy that we inherited starting to roll a bit? Sure, Mr. Bessent said. Danielle Kaye After fluctuating this morning, stocks have turned downward, with the SP 500 falling about 0.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite off roughly 0.8 percent. Even though the jobs numbers for February didnt prompt a knee-jerk response from Wall Street, the Trump administrations on-again, off-again approach to tariffs has put investors on edge, raising concerns about the effects on the economy in the months ahead.

Fired Federal Workers Face a Sluggish Job Market,"For about a year now, the labor market has existed in a state of eerie calm: Not many people were losing their jobs or quitting, but not many of those seeking work were getting job offers. The mass layoffs now underway across the federal government, along with its employees who are voluntarily heading for the exits, could disrupt that uneasy equilibrium. While unemployment is relatively low at 4.1 percent, those losing their positions could face a difficult time finding work, depending on how well their skills translate to a private sector that does not seem eager to hire. Federal workers all across the country are starting to look, and its impacting people everywhere, said Cory Stahle, an economist at the job search platform Indeed. Its hard to think this isnt going to stress test the labor market in the coming months. On the eve of the Trump administration, the federal governments executive branch employed about 2.3 million civilians. Its not clear how many of those will end up being cut, and how many will get their jobs back after lawsuits over those terminations work through the courts. But the impact of the pace at which government spending is being slashed, along with instructions from the White House budget office for agencies to slice even deeper, could be meaningful.

"How Dan Bongino Would Run the F.B.I., According to Dan Bongino","To hear Dan Bongino describe it, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is the single most corrupt law enforcement institution in America and a full-blown leftist political action committee devoted to covering up Democratic crimes and withholding the truth from the American people. It is time for an absolute housecleaning, he said in 2023. Now Mr. Bongino  the longtime right-wing pundit, podcaster and vocal ally of President Trump  has been tapped to serve as the agencys new deputy director. His podcast and radio show will end production on March 14. The job, which does not require Senate confirmation, has traditionally been filled by a senior agent with vast operational experience and a deep understanding of how the bureaus various divisions work. The last two deputy directors together had more than 35 years of experience before they assumed the role. Mr. Bongino served as a police officer and a U.S. Secret Service agent years ago, but has no experience with the F.B.I. Mr. Bonginos precise plans for the agency remain opaque, but on recent podcasts he has said he would rid the agency of politicization and focus on crimes like drug dealing  despite the bureaus broad mandate to protect national security, investigate crimes and root out corruption by public officials at all levels. Taken together, Mr. Bonginos years of comments on his radio show and podcast have painted a vision for dramatic change at the F.B.I., as he put it last week. Those ideas largely align with criticisms put forth by his friend Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed as the director of the agency. Some of their ideas, however, would probably require additional funding. The F.B.I. declined to comment, but it recently rejected charges of corruption leveled by a Republican cabinet secretary, saying such claims are not supported by any evidence and undermine the men and women of the F.B.I.

How the Crypto Exchange Bybit Lost $1.5 Billion to North Korean Hackers,"On the night of Feb. 21, Ben Zhou, the chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, logged on to his computer to approve what appeared to be a routine transaction. His company was moving a large amount of Ether, a popular digital currency, from one account to another. Thirty minutes later, Mr. Zhou got a call from Bybits chief financial officer. In a trembling voice, the executive told Mr. Zhou that their system had been hacked. All of the Ethereum is gone, he said. When Mr. Zhou approved the transaction, he had inadvertently handed control of an account to hackers backed by the North Korean government, according to the F.B.I. They stole 1.5 billion in cryptocurrencies, the largest heist in the industrys history. To pull off the astonishing breach, the hackers exploited a simple flaw in Bybits security: its reliance on a free software product. They penetrated Bybit by manipulating a publicly available system that the exchange used to safeguard hundreds of millions of dollars in customer deposits. For years, Bybit had relied on the storage software, developed by a technology provider called Safe, even as other security firms sold more specialized tools for businesses. The hack sent crypto markets into a free fall and undermined confidence in the industry at a crucial time. Under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, industry executives are lobbying for new U.S. laws and regulations that would make it easier for people to pour their savings into digital currencies. On Friday, the White House is scheduled to host a crypto summit with President Trump and top industry officials. Crypto security experts said they were troubled by what the heist revealed about Bybits safety protocols. The losses were completely preventable, one security firm wrote in an analysis of the breach, arguing that it should not have happened. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Many Chinese See a Cultural Revolution in America,"As the United States grapples with the upheaval unleashed by the Trump administration, many Chinese people are finding they can relate to what many Americans are going through. They are saying it feels something like the Cultural Revolution, the period known as the decade of turmoil. The young aides Elon Musk has sent to dismantle the U.S. government reminded some Chinese of the Red Guards whom Mao Zedong enlisted to destroy the bureaucracy at the peak of the Cultural Revolution. Upon hearing President Trumps musing about serving a third term, they joked that Chinas leader, Xi Jinping, must be saying, I know how to do it  he secured one in 2022 by engineering a constitutional change. The United States helped China modernize and expand its economy in the hope that China would become more like America  more democratic and more open. Now for some Chinese, the United States is looking more and more like China. Coming from an authoritarian state, we know that dictatorship is not just a system  it is, at its core, the pursuit of power, Wang Jian, a journalist, wrote in an X post criticizing Mr. Trump. We also know that the Cultural Revolution was about dismantling institutions to expand control. For these Chinese, who strive for democratic values but contend with an authoritarian state, their role model is tearing itself down. They are expressing their alarm in interviews, articles and social media comments that range in emotion from disappointment and anger to sardonic. Beacon of democracy, 1776-2025, wrote a commenter on a post by the official Weibo social media account of the U.S. Embassy in China. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Walgreens to Be Acquired by Sycamore Partners in $10 Billion Deal,"Walgreens Boots Alliance said on Thursday that it had agreed to be acquired by Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm, in a 10 billion deal that will take the struggling pharmacy chain out of the glare of public markets. Walgreens has faced declining prescription reimbursements and falling sales at its retail locations for years  a trend that has hit a number of major pharmacy chains. After rapidly expanding their brick-and-mortar footprint, pharmacy companies now say its harder to turn a profit from selling prescriptions, citing pressure from middlemen. Cautious spending from consumers who have been grappling with inflation, coupled with competition from retail behemoths like Amazon and Walmart, has also dampened pharmacies sales of household items ranging from snacks to cleaning supplies. Walgreens, which owns the Duane Reade chain in the New York City area and the Boots pharmacies in Britain, has been closing stores, with hundreds more set to be shuttered in the years ahead. The buyout follows a roughly 50 percent drop in the companys share price in the past year. Its market value, which peaked at over 100 billion a decade ago, dropped below 8 billion before news of the potential takeover first broke late last year. Sycamore has agreed to pay 11.45 per share, an 8 percent premium from Thursdays closing share price. Signs of strain at the chain have been clear for months. The company reported a net loss of 8.6 billion for the entire 2024 fiscal year, nearly triple the previous years loss. But it beat earnings and revenue expectations in its most recent reported quarter, which ended in November. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump Suspends Mexico and Canada Tariffs on USMCA Goods for a Month,"Two days after imposing sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, President Trump on Thursday abruptly suspended many of those levies, sowing confusion with investors and businesses that depend on trade with the countries. The president said he would allow products that are traded under the rules of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade pact he signed in his first term, to avoid the stiff 25 percent tariffs he imposed just days ago on two of Americas largest trading partners. The suspension effectively abandons many of the tariffs that Mr. Trump had placed on Canadian and Mexican products  levies he said were necessary to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. His decision came a day after he said he would grant a 30-day reprieve to automakers, who had complained to the president that the levies would cause severe damage to U.S. carmakers. Mr. Trump implied that any relief would be short-lived, saying that other tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products are coming in April. Mr. Trumps chaotic, stop-and-start approach has sent stock markets tumbling and generated anxiety among industries that depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, which account for more than a quarter of U.S. imports and nearly a third of U.S. exports. After Mr. Trump imposed his tariffs, Canada retaliated with levies on 20.5 billion worth of American goods, including agricultural products, and Mexico was threatening to impose its own import taxes on U.S. goods on Sunday if Mr. Trump did not relent. Still, the decision to suspend the tariffs did little to calm financial markets, which have been jittery since Mr. Trump ratcheted up his trade war earlier this week. In addition to hitting Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump placed a second 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, prompting another round of retaliation from Beijing on American products. The president has not suspended any of his levies on China.

Trump Seeks to Bar Student Loan Relief to Workers Aiding Migrants and Trans Kids,"President Trump signed an executive order instructing administration officials to alter a student loan forgiveness program for public servants to exclude nonprofit organizations that engage in activities that have what he called a substantial illegal purpose. His order to restrict the program appears to target groups supporting undocumented immigrants, diversity initiatives or gender-affirming care for children, among others, as the Trump administration has sought to eliminate federal support for efforts that have drawn right-wing ire. The order, made public on Friday, is the latest of many attempts to overhaul the loan forgiveness program, which has often whipsawed borrowers with rule changes and bureaucratic obstacles. The program, known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, was created by Congress in 2007 and cannot be eliminated without congressional action, but the Education Department has some leeway to determine how it operates. Mr. Trumps executive order directed the secretaries of education and the Treasury to amend the program to exclude workers for organizations supporting illegal actions, listing several categories of examples, including aiding or abetting violations of federal immigration law. The Trump administration has taken a broad view of what it considers to be support of illegal activities. The order cited as examples organizations that support illegal discrimination, which the administration has previously said includes diversity and inclusion initiatives. The order appeared to target groups supporting gender-affirming care. It said it would exclude from the loan forgiveness program any organization supporting child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.

U.S. Investigates Egg Producers Over Soaring Prices,"The Justice Department is in the early stages of investigating major egg producers in the United States over possible antitrust violations as the price of eggs skyrockets, two people familiar with the matter said. The departments lawyers are preparing to send civil investigative demands  effectively subpoenas for civil investigations  to several producers, including Cal-Maine Foods and Rose Acre Farms, one of the people said. Investigators are looking at whether the companies are sharing sensitive information about pricing and supply, contributing to a spike in prices. The inquiry is being run out of the antitrust divisions Chicago office, the people said. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation. Cal-Maine and Rose Acre did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The Capitol Forum earlier reported the inquiry. Egg prices began soaring last year, and they quickly became an issue in the presidential campaign. Producers have blamed the spread of avian flu, which has forced them to cull millions of hens, for tighter egg supplies and prices that have surpassed 8 a dozen in some areas. The Justice Departments inquiry may not lead to a lawsuit. Some lawmakers and advocacy groups previously called for federal regulators to investigate the industrys pricing practices. Roughly 15 percent of the countrys egg-laying chickens have been killed in the past four months, while wholesale egg prices have risen 255 percent, according to data from Expana, which tracks the prices of eggs.

"At Crypto Summit, Trump Says U.S. Will Be ‘the Bitcoin Superpower’","Sitting beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, more than two dozen of the most powerful figures in the U.S. cryptocurrency industry, together worth many billions of dollars, gathered in the White House on Friday for an audience with President Trump. When Mr. Trump entered the ornate State Dining Room after a short wait, the executives rose to applaud him. Many of you have been fighting for years for this, Mr. Trump said as the room quieted. Its an honor to be with you at the White House. Mr. Trump was holding a first-of-its-kind crypto summit, meeting face to face with the leaders of virtually all of the top crypto companies in the United States. Only a small portion of the gathering, which was scheduled to last four hours, was broadcast to the public. But it offered a vivid illustration of Mr. Trumps recent embrace of crypto, a renegade industry that has spent years battling with U.S. regulators. Several executives, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, offered words of gratitude to Mr. Trump. They called him wonderful, saying they were overjoyed with his approach. High I.Q. individuals around this table, Mr. Trump responded. Since he took office, Mr. Trump has orchestrated a complete transformation of federal policy on crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission has almost entirely reversed an aggressive campaign by the Biden administration to crack down on the industry. The agency, moving with astonishing speed, has issued legal guidance to help crypto companies, ended investigations into major firms and dropped lawsuits against two of the largest exchanges, Coinbase and Kraken.

Trump’s Delay on Mexico and Canada Tariffs Came in Response to Market Revolt,"A month ago, President Trump announced that he would impose sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico before reaching a last-minute deal to delay them for 30 days. This week, after markets revolted when the tariffs were put in place, Mr. Trump watered them down with a monthlong reprieve for automakers. And then on Thursday, he opened up even broader exemptions for many other products that are imported from Americas neighbors to the north and south after intense lobbying from business groups that warned of rising prices. Mr. Trump has spent the last month or so bouncing between imposing sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and delaying them because of last-minute deals. There will, he said, always be changes and adjustments. Despite Mr. Trumps insistence that tariff is among his favorite words, the waffling over import duties reflects the reality that steep import taxes are not an antidote for every policy problem facing the nation. Mr. Trumps economic advisers continue to contend that the tariffs are part of a broader agenda that will not damage the economy. However, the delays and loopholes reveal that they are beginning to see the risks of taking tariffs too far at a time when the economy is showing signs of strain and consumers are still reeling from inflation.

Sam Bankman-Fried Lobbies Trump Associates in Hopes of a Pardon,"Consulting with a lawyer who has ties to President Trump. Reaching out to Washington lobbyists. And sitting for a jailhouse interview with Tucker Carlson. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency mogul who was once a top Democratic donor, has embarked on a long-shot campaign to secure a pardon from the Trump administration, six people with knowledge of the matter said. The effort has been driven by a small group of Mr. Bankman-Frieds supporters, including his parents, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, who are trying to help their son escape the 25-year prison sentence he received after he was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in the collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX. There is no indication that the Bankman-Frieds and their allies have reached Mr. Trump directly or discussed a potential pardon with his White House advisers. But the push appears intended to capitalize on Mr. Trumps transactional approach to clemency. The president has favored pardon seekers with connections to him  either personally or through lawyers and lobbyists  and claims of prosecutorial misconduct that echo his own grievances about the cases against him. As part of the clemency effort, Mr. Bankman and Ms. Fried, who are Stanford University law professors and longtime active Democrats, are consulting with Kory Langhofer, an Arizona lawyer who worked for Mr. Trumps 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. Politically connected businesspeople and Washington lobbyists have also received outreach from intermediaries who claim to be allies of Mr. Bankman-Fried, three people with knowledge of the situation said.

Trump Organization Sues Capital One for Closing Its Accounts,"President Trumps family business sued Capital One on Friday for unjustifiably terminating more than 300 of its bank accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the latest sign that the president and his allies are seeking retribution against those who once shunned them. In a complaint filed in state court in Florida, the Trump Organization accused the bank of arbitrarily closing its accounts in June 2021 in violation of various consumer protection laws. The accounts held millions of dollars at the time, according to the lawsuit. By filing this lawsuit, we seek to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods, the company said in a statement. The bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, did not provide a reason at the time for closing the accounts, the lawsuit said. But in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when Mr. Trumps supporters stormed the Capitol, a number of financial institutions cut ties with his familys real estate business. The groups lawsuit against Capital One could portend similar actions against other banks. More to come, Eric Trump, one of the plaintiffs and the leader of the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Friday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Intuitive Machines Athena Moon Lander Dies After Toppling Over,"A day after landing on the moon, the robotic Athena spacecraft built by Intuitive Machines of Houston is dead. In an update on its website on Friday, the company confirmed that Athena had tipped onto its side  the same fate that befell its first lunar lander, Odysseus, last year. With its solar panels unable to face the sun, the spacecrafts batteries could not recharge. The company said it did not expect the spacecraft to revive. Before the spacecraft fell silent, it said mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones. On Friday afternoon, NASA reported that some of its payloads were able to turn on and send back data before the lander stopped working. The mission was supposed to last 10 days until the darkness of lunar night fell over that part of the moon. The mission was part of a NASA program known as Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, to contract private companies to carry science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon at a lower cost. Another robotic spacecraft that is part of CLPS, the Blue Ghost lander by Firefly Aerospace of Cedar Park, Texas, touched down on Sunday and is conducting science experiments on another part of the moon. Athena landed on Thursday on a flat-topped mountain named Mons Mouton, about 100 miles from the moons south pole. It was the southernmost landing site of any spacecraft.

Can an LED face mask really transform your skin?,"LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting. But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from 40 to 1,500. The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly. Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny? The LED market is set to be worth 600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point. According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM). This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin, he tells the BBC. PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin, he adds. A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works. US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration. Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists for many years, according to Dr Kentley. But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices. The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skins surface when being used. Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks sound promising, mask wholesale manufacturers are speculating about their benefits. I dont believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital, she tells the BBC. No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident. So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest, she adds. Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year. This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends. Dr Kluk says she has noticed that peoples interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid and believes the visually interesti...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c334jg7lvz0o,2025-03-08
UK authorities on lookout for Lassa fever cases,"UK officials are checking for any possible cases of Lassa fever after a traveller to England, who has since returned to Nigeria, is known to have been infected. The virus does not spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the public is very low, experts advise. Anyone yet to be contacted by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is very unlikely to have had any exposure, they say. In some West African countries, where the disease is endemic, people usually become infected through exposure to food, or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of rats. Lassa fever is rare in the UK, but there have been a small number of cases before - most recently in 2022. UK officials say they are well-equipped to identify people who have Lassa fever to limit any spread of infections. The UKHSA says it is working at speed to find anyone who may have had contact with the person who had Lassa fever. Dr Meera Chand, deputy director at the UK Health Security Agency, said: Our health protection teams are working at pace to get in touch with people who were in contact with this individual while they were in England, to ensure they seek appropriate medical care and testing should they develop any symptoms. The infection does not spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the UK population is very low. People who are found to have Lassa fever will receive supportive treatment, meaning that they will be provided with fluids, monitored for their symptoms, and treated with medications depending on which symptoms they have. There is not currently an effective single treatment for the disease. Source: UKHSA",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vwzk2y52no,2025-03-08
'Nasal tanners left me suffocating in hospital',"A woman has told how she was left in hospital unable to breathe after suffering a severe reaction to an unlicensed nasal tanning spray she bought online. Edith Eagle said she felt like she was suffocating and drowning inside her own body after the allergic collapse she believes was linked to the product. Nasal tanners are designed to be sprayed into the nostrils and claim to work by administering a substance known as Melanotan II, a chemical that darkens skin pigmentation. It is illegal to sell medicinal products containing Melanotan II in the UK but as the tanners are sold cosmetically they fall outside that remit. However, they are not covered by UK cosmetics regulations, meaning they are not subjected to the same scrutiny as other over-the-counter beauty products. Experts have said they have not been fully researched and could contain toxic ingredients. Ms Eagle said she purchased tanners online believing they would give her a quick and easy bronzed look ahead of a planned holiday to Fuerteventura in April 2023. They had been recommended to her by someone she knew, but she said she did not realise they were unlicensed and unregulated. The 47-year-old, from Kings Lynn in Norfolk, inhaled the spray twice a day, believing it would give her tan time to build up before we actually get into the sunshine. But on the second day of the trip she was rushed to hospital after the apparent allergic reaction spiralled. I literally could not breathe, she said. And all what went through my mind was, will I even get to the hospital because I could not breathe. I cant even explain it, but I was suffocating inside. It was as if I was drowning within my own body. Ms Eagle said she became suspicious after her stepdaughter, who also used a tanner, spotted a Facebook post from someone who said they had also suffered a bad reaction. She told her hospital consultant, who asked where she had bought the tanner and what was in it. He also became suspicious, she said. Of course, there was nothing on it apart from a pretty label on the front, no ingredients whatsoever. There was nothing, really, I could show him. And that was a frightening thing, she said. Once I was allowed to go back to the hotel the consultant said Just remember next time, you may not be so lucky. The products are promoted on social media and are readily available to buy online, while the BBC has also found beauty salons and tanning shops advertising them for sale. The BBC North West and North East Investigations team visited high street premises to see how easy they were to obtain. In Manchester and on Merseyside, a reporter managed to purchase several sprays from salons for between 20 and 25, sold with minimal instructions and no acknowledgment of any risks or dangers. In Newcastle, a staff member at a gym sold a reporter an extreme strength spray for 25, with verbal instructions to use it before taking a sun bed. Also on Merseyside, the BBC was able to buy a quadruple strength spray on offer for 20, ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4p4v8y8eo,2025-03-08
More schools to be asked to supervise toothbrushing,"School and nursery staff in the most deprived areas of England will be asked to supervise young children while they brush their teeth, under a national toothbrushing programme. Schemes are already running in some schools - but now dedicated central funding will reach the poorest areas where children are most at risk of tooth decay, the government says. Dental experts said the move would save children from pain and the NHS a fortune. But the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) union said caution was needed to avoid shifting what is ultimately a parental responsibility on to the burden on schools. National supervised toothbrushing programmes have been running in Scotland since 2006 and Wales since 2009. And in Northern Ireland, some nursery staff have been supervising toothbrushing since 2016, in a funded programme targeting the poorest 20 of areas. Teachers and other staff demonstrate and help, without directly brushing the childrens teeth, at some point during the school day. The idea, according to experts, is not to replace toothbrushing at home but to help build skills, good habits and confidence. But in England, provision is patchy, partly because of logistical problems but also a lack of staff and dedicated funding. About one out of every four five-year-olds in England has had tooth decay - and in poorer areas, it is one in three. Tooth decay is the most common reason five-to-nine-year-olds in England are admitted to hospital. And in many areas, access to an NHS dentist has become increasingly difficult. Abbies daughter goes to a nursery in Bridlington where toothbrushing lessons already take place. She says her toddler was quite toothbrush shy but the scheme has helped. When we first started toothbrushing she refused to do it at home  it was a two person job. I think in nursery it is different, it is quite an event. They all do it together - it is quite social, they sing a song, she told the BBC. Bridlington only has one NHS dentist practice accepting patients. Her children and husband have had to register in a different town. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said focusing on prevention would help give children the best start in life. It is shocking that a third of five-year-olds in the most deprived areas have experience of tooth decay - something we know can have a lifelong impact on their health, he said. Its why were delivering supervised toothbrushing to young children and families who are most in need of support, as part of our wider plans to revive the oral health of the nation. The government says it is also working to reform the dental contract, so dentists take on more NHS work. From April, local authorities will be given 11m funding and asked to identify schools and nurseries most in need. The aim is to reach about 600,000 three-to-five-year-olds a year. For every 1 spent on the scheme, 3 in treatment costs will be avoided  adding up to more than 34m over the next five years, the government says. Some children will use the...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8r4vx4j38o,2025-03-08
Victim records claims sickening - attacks families,"The families of the Nottingham attack victims have said claims healthcare staff illegally accessed medical records belonging to their loved ones are sickening and inexcusable. Barnaby Webber and Grace OMalley-Kumar, both 19, and Ian Coates, 65, were stabbed to death by Valdo Calocane in the city in June 2023. Dr Manjeet Shehmar, medical director at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said the trust was investigating concerns that members of staff may have inappropriately accessed the medical records of the three victims. The families described the news as distressing and traumatic in a joint statement. The families of Ian, Grace, and Barnaby have already had to endure much pain and heartache and Im truly sorry that this will add further to their suffering, Dr Shehmar said. Through our investigation, we will find out what happened and will not hesitate to take action as necessary. The claims of the medical records being accessed inappropriately were first reported by the Daily Mirror. In a joint statement, the families of Mr Coates, Ms OMalley-Kumar and Mr Webber said: We cannot begin to describe how distressing and traumatic it is for us to learn of yet more revelations regarding the actions of individuals in the horror of losing our loved ones. These are not just data breaches for us, they are gross invasions of privacy and civil liberty. For people to choose to access information regarding the vicious attack and murder of Barney, Grace and Ian with no reason to do so is sickening. Its gross and inexcusable voyeurism at the most repugnant level. We know that whilst some staff across the multiple agencies would need to access records, images and data, dozens, perhaps even hundreds, didnt. God only knows what may have been looked at, discussed and shared. It comes a few months after an investigation was opened into allegations Ministry of Justice (MoJ) staff illegally accessed computer files related to the Nottingham attacks. A special constable with Nottinghamshire Police was previously sacked for viewing bodycam footage showing the aftermath of the attacks. In the June 2023 attack, Calocane killed Mr Webber, Ms OMalley-Kumar and Mr Coates, before using Mr Coatess van to drive into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - in the city centre. Calocane was sentenced to a hospital order in January 2024 after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Following Calocanes sentencing, the families were highly critical of the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). A subsequent review into the CPS found that while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocanes pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better. There have been a number of other reviews, including an investigation into the NHS mental healthcare and treatment he received prior to the killings, published in early February. This identified a catalogue of failings, includi...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39vd2kjj3lo,2025-03-08
Scientists discover new part of the immune system,"A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said. Theyve shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals. The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection. And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs. The discovery centres on the proteasome  a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body. Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones. But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria. It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them. Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening. We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection. Its happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics. The research team went through a process they called dumpster diving to find these natural antibiotics. They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics. And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella. Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were extremely provocative and very interesting as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection. Whats really exciting about this, is its a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising. But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that still needs to be tested and that will take time. More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics. But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand. Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists. Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at Kings College London, told the BBC: Its a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, thats quite exciting. In previous years its been digging up soil to find new antibiotics, it is wild that its something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.

Common vaginal 'imbalance' may be an STI,"A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers. The NHS currently says BV is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI, even though it can be triggered by sex. However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI. The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection. BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell. The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery. Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though. Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching. It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams. In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics. The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach. One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI. Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still dont know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery, she added. In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment. Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected  that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections. This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases, said a spokesperson. If you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lj7e0519xo,2025-03-08
The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want,"The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but thats not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s. Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer. His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone. Apart from medication from Terrys GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, there was nothing, says Gillian. I couldnt understand why  we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didnt know what to do and was doing my best to care for him. He was in agony at times  crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless. As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him, says Gillian. He died just over two weeks later. He was 67. It was not how he wanted to spend his last days, she tells me today. I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did. Terry and Gillians story is far from unique  and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives. Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms. Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel coerced by a lack of better alternatives. Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home, Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital. It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any. And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months. But this hasnt always been the case - until recently the picture was very different. As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palli...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zv670m7no,2025-03-08
Boots recalls paracetamol over labelling error,"The High Street pharmacy chain Boots is asking customers to return packs of 500-milligram paracetamol tablets because a labelling error incorrectly states they are a different painkiller, aspirin. More than 110,000 packs, with the batch number 241005 and expiry date 122029 on the bottom, are affected. Customers can receive a full refund without a receipt. Boots and the supplier, Aspar Pharmaceuticals Limited, have begun a full investigation. The outer cardboard packaging is correctly labelled: Paracetamol 500mg Tablets but the inner foil blister pack of pills instead reads: Aspirin 300mg Dispersable Tablets. The affected packs should not be used or kept, even if the error is known, as this could lead to an incorrect dose. And anyone who has bought this product for someone else should tell them as soon as possible. Dr Stephanie Millican, from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said: Patient safety is always our priority. It is vitally important that you check the packaging of your Boots Paracetamol 500mg Tablets 16s - and if the batch number is 241005, you should stop using the product and return it to a Boots store for a full refund. If you are unsure which pack you have purchased or have taken Boots Paracetamol 500mg Tablets and experienced any side effects, seek advice from a healthcare professional. Please report any suspected adverse reactions via the MHRAs Yellow Card scheme. If you have any questions or require further advice, please seek advice from your pharmacist or other relevant healthcare professional. Paracetamol is an effective painkiller for mild or moderate pain. It may be better than aspirin for headaches, toothache, sprains and stomach ache. Aspirin may be better than paracetamol for period pain or migraines, says the NHS. Aspirin stops your body making compounds called prostaglandins and this lowers the pain and reduces swelling and high temperature. Ibuprofen - another type of painkiller, known as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID - works in a similar way to aspirin.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7xn5lyxemo,2025-03-08
Warning over rapid at-home prostate tests,"At-home tests for men worried about prostate cancer can give inconsistent and inaccurate results, BBC News has found. The tests, which resemble a Covid lateral flow strip, turn positive if a high level of a protein called PSA is detected in a drop of blood. Of five rapid tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative or all-clear, but one returned a false positive result - all from the same blood sample. Prostate Cancer UK said it had significant concerns about the sale of the tests given their questionable accuracy and the absence of a doctor to interpret the results. There is no national prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. Instead, the onus is on men to request a blood test from their GP once they are over 50 years old, or from 45 for higher risk groups. That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen. A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease. PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer. Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024. Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels. They are available online and from some pharmacies and convenience stores with prices from 6 to 95. They come in two main types: The BBC analysed five rapid tests all bought online from different companies, using a blood sample taken on the same day. The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer and must not claim to detect cancer. Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to screen for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules. Others are sold to monitor prostate health or identify potential prostate issues early. One of the home tests ordered by the BBC also arrived in packaging and with instructions clearly marked for professional use only. For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use. A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette. Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ugl. A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ugl. As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy, says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl00gn15y8o,2025-03-08
Autistic woman wrongly locked up in mental health hospital for 45 years,"An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned. The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years. Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her. The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention. More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness. The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol. But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10 reduction. However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we havent seen the progress that was promised, he told us. Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibbas incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her. I hadnt ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised, Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day. Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibbas identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held. It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a childrens home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital. Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as dangerous and an eye-gouger. She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to t...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly43png991o,2025-03-08
Over 50% of adults worldwide predicted to be obese or overweight by 2050,"More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050. The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries. Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries. However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a profound tragedy. By 2021, almost half the global adult population - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese. The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990. If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4 for men and 60.3 for women by 2050. In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050. However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250 to 522 million. Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese. The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future. Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems. The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US. She said: Governments can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies. The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure, she added. A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people. Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8 to 18.1) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9 to 20.3) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021. However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected. The co-lead author of the report, Dr Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Australia, says the figures present a real challenge to health care systems in the coming years. But if we act now, preventing a complete transition t...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87d2g81yxo,2025-03-08
'He was born navy blue': Real-life stories behind Toxic Town Netflix series,"Netflixs new drama Toxic Town revisits one of the UKs biggest environmental scandals: the Corby toxic waste case. The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution. Corbys steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks. By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination. In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste. Families affected won an undisclosed financial settlement in 2010, held in trust until the children turned 18. Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents. Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted. Here are some of the key voices behind the story. George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby. Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift. Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers Georges birth, an event that would change their lives forever. Born navy blue as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care. It was then Fiona noticed something unusual. I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger, she says. It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out. I just kept thinking, Hes here because of me, and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself. At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in Georges hand so large that amputation became a real possibility. The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. When I woke up, I was so full of morphine, he remembers. They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice  my body just shut down. The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. They burn flesh as they operate: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And thats the smell that still comes to you from time to time. Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. The first time I saw my hand, I wasnt shocked. I wasnt sad. It was better than before. But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions. Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything. On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to h...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pzl605kzo,2025-03-08
Cancer family 'financially broken' by benefits wait,"Families of children and young people with cancer are struggling financially for several months waiting for benefits to help cover extra costs caused by the illness, according to a charity. Young Lives vs Cancer says families need immediate help with additional living costs, which amount to 700 a month on average - and is calling for quicker access to the funds. One family has said they were left financially broken by the extra living costs after their 16-year-old son Olivers leg had to be amputated because he had a rare type of cancer. The government says it is committed to giving people access to benefits in a timely manner, but acknowledges that waits are too high. Kerry Bolton, from Solihull, said she had to wait five months before a decision was made on her benefits application after her son Oliver was diagnosed with cancer, aged 16. The hospital is an hour away from us and I dont drive. It was costing us 48 a day for us to travel in taxis there and back. Oliver later underwent a leg amputation, meaning his family had to buy new clothes to fit him. They also faced higher electricity bills to charge his prosthetic leg, Ms Bolton said. Ollies leg needs electricity...if I dont have electricity, he cant walk. Ms Bolton said she also had to use more energy to heat her home to keep Oliver warm, because of his immunosuppression treatment. During a childs cancer treatment, families may need to travel to distant appointments, buy special food, use more electricity and heating, pay for childcare for siblings, and stay in hotels. Under UK law, cancer patients may be entitled to benefits to help with costs. However, patients are not eligible for financial support until they have been ill for three months. They then face a further wait of four months on average for their application to be assessed, according to Young Lives vs Cancer, which has interviewed hundreds of patients and put out a new report. The charity is calling for families to qualify for benefits immediately following a diagnosis. Danielle Roberts, from North Wales, told the BBC that she experienced financial strain as soon as her nine-year-old daughter Jasmine was diagnosed with cancer last year, but she did not receive any benefits for eight months. We were just thrown into this world where...our childs got cancer and we dont know if shes going to survive, along with dealing with the financial impact. Youve still got all these bills to pay on top of going back and forward to hospital, which was an hour and 15 minutes away, extra food, accommodation. Ms Roberts said having to take long periods off work added to the financial strain. My income was dramatically reduced because its hard to work when your child is in hospital... and you dont want to work, you should be able to spend time with your child when theyre poorly. What were seeing is heartbreaking, Young People vs Cancers chief executive Rachel Kirby-Rider told the BBC.

UK death rate 'reaches record low',"The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News. Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019. However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement. The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, its pretty poor by historical standards, said Stuart McDonald from the CMI. There was also a concerning rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said. A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was shifting focus from sickness to prevention. The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances. From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths. To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK. Clearly, its very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was, says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The Kings Fund. But if you look at the broader canvas then its not so good. Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UKs has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the bottom of the pack of comparable countries, she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the low hanging fruit of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder. At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS. Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say its not possible to prove this directly. Dementia and Alzheimers disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK, said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.

GPs strike deal to help end '8am scramble' for appointments,"Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with Englands GPs, the government has said. The deal gives an extra 889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients. The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back family doctors and end the early morning phone scramble for appointments. The doctors union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices. However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament. GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under. Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments. Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar 8am scramble for a same-day appointment. Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am. It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up. Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised. The new contract says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need. The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2. The total figure includes almost 800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients. Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff. GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations. Through cutting what the government describes as box-ticking targets, ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the 8am scramble for an appointment. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as a broken NHS. Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared, he said. Thats why patients are struggling to get an appointment. This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs time and backing them with an extra 889m next year. In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment. Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs committee, says this contract is...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7ee895nr0o,2025-03-08
Cancer patients 'may starve' without vital drug,"Cancer patients and others with debilitating conditions have highlighted shortages of a vital drug they say have had a devastating impact on their lives. Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert), helps digestion, but has been hard to obtain for the last year and shortages are predicted to last until 2026. It is thought more than 61,000 patients in the UK need it, including those with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. Some patients said through Your Voice, Your BBC News that they have had to cover long distances to find a pharmacist with supplies. The Department of Health and Social care says it is working closely with the NHS, manufacturers and others in the supply chain to try to resolve the issues. Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which means their ability to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy is reduced. Diana Gibb, who is 74, and her husband Mick, 78, live in Tonbridge, Kent. Mick had a major operation to treat pancreatic cancer in 2023. Diana wrote to BBC News explaining that it is impossible for Mick to digest food without creon. She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine. We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week. Pharmacies cannot get hold of lower dosage either and there is no alternative medication. I was worried that my husband would starve to death without them. Diana says for now they can get supplies of the drug but there is no guarantee week-to-week, and that is still a big worry. Bryony Thomas, who is from Stroud in Gloucestershire, needs creon after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly. She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe. At one stage, she says she obtained the drug from another patient, who had a surplus, against regulations via Instagram. She describes her situation as constantly stressful. Leading pancreatic clinicians and charities including Pancreatic Cancer UK have written to the prime minister saying the absence of Pert can have a devastating impact on peoples lives, with doctors and pharmacists inundated with requests for help from desparate patients. The letter says that without the drug, people experience horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life. There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical ex...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry84d5jq5o,2025-03-08
Physician associate role is 'misleading' - coroner,"A coroner has said the public is being misled over what an NHS physician associate (PA) does after a woman died following hospital failings, including being misdiagnosed with a nosebleed. Pamela Marking went to AE at East Surrey Hospital in February 2024 after vomiting blood and having tenderness in her side. She was told by a PA she had a nosebleed and was sent home, but the 77-year-old actually had a hernia and died four days later following complications with her care after being readmitted to hospital. A Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust spokesperson said it would look carefully at the coroners report to learn lessons on improving services and delivering the safest possible care. Our deepest sympathies remain with Ms Markings family and loved ones at this very difficult time, they added. We wish to express our profound regret for their loss. An NHS spokesperson said the NHS has always been clear that physician associates are not replacements for doctors and should only practice with appropriate medical supervision. But there remain legitimate concerns about the roles, they added. The coroners prevention of future deaths report, sent to the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England, said the PA did not understand the significance of Ms Markings symptoms and had not examined her fully. Dr Karen Henderson, assistant coroner for Surrey, called the term physician associate misleading and said there was a lack of public knowledge that they were not medically qualified. PAs are graduates - usually with a health or life sciences degree - who have undertaken two years of postgraduate training. The NHS said they work under the supervision of a doctor and can diagnose people, take medical histories, perform physical examinations, see patients with long-term conditions, analyse test results and develop management plans. This blurring of roles without public knowledge... has the potential to devalue and undermine public confidence in the medical profession, said Dr Henderson. She added it could also compromise patient safety with PAs potentially undertaking roles outside their competency. The Department of Health and Social Care said it had launched an independent review into physician associates to establish the facts and make sure that we get the right people in the right places providing the right care.

Health chiefs warn of potential second norovirus wave,"People who have already had norovirus, the winter vomiting bug, could be at risk of catching it again this season, experts from the the UKs Health Security Agency say. Data shows a different strain of the virus is on the rise and having had one strain doesnt necessarily protect you from catching another, they advise. Norovirus can be particularly severe for young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Cases are currently still exceptionally high with numbers at more than double the five-season-average for this time of year, latest figure show. Amy Douglas, Lead Epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said the biggest impact was being seen in hospitals and care homes. With multiple genotypes spreading at the same time, people could end up getting infected more than once this season, she added. Cases have been higher than expected partly because of the emergence of a recent strain of the virus called GII.17, but also because of improved ways of testing for the virus. Data now shows that a different, but more commonly seen strain, is on the rise. This means people who have already had the bug could catch it again as having one version of the virus does not fully protect you against the other. There is no suggestion that either strain leads to more severe illness than expected, however. Norovirus cases usually starts to decline as the weather warms up, but the UKHSA says it is too soon to work out whether cases have peaked. The total remains close to its record high, with an average of 1,134 patients a day in hospital with norovirus last week  down slightly on the previous week (1,160), but still nearly two and a half times that seen in the same period last year. Symptoms of norovirus include: If you think you may have norovirus, experts advise: Many household disinfectants do not work well against the virus. Nor do alcohol hand gels. If you are concerned - for example if a young child is not able to keep fluids down or the illness does not stop after a few days - make sure you seek medical advice Do not visit hospitals and care homes or prepare food for others, until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlyy2e5w4vo,2025-03-08
Michelle Mone-linked PPE firm evidence to be heard in private,"The chair of the Covid inquiry has ruled that evidence related to PPE Medpro, the firm linked to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, will be heard in a closed, private session next month. On 3 March, the inquiry will begin four weeks of hearings into decisions to buy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Baroness Hallett said she was imposing the restriction as she was satisfied there was a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings if sensitive evidence was heard in public. Victims groups and media outlets, including the BBC, had argued the dangers were overstated, given the early stage of the police investigation and the material already in the public domain. The National Crime Agency (NCA) opened an investigation into PPE Medpro in May 2021 into suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement of PPE. The company was awarded government contracts worth more than 200m after Baroness Mone recommended the firm to ministers during the Covid pandemic. Baroness Mone, 52, and Mr Barrowman, 59, have denied wrongdoing. In June 2024, the NCA said an unnamed 46-year-old man from Barnet, north London, had been arrested as part of its investigation. To date, no criminal charges have been brought and the Crown Prosecution Service has not been formally instructed by the NCA. On 9 December 2024, the Covid inquiry said it had received an application from the NCA for a restriction order, claiming there was a risk of harm to its investigation if sensitive evidence about PPE Medpro was heard in public. The NCA originally wanted to prevent the inquiry hearing any evidence about the company, saying other contracts could be selected. It then asked for 26 witness statements written by its staff to be withheld, and an order to be made preventing certain questions about the firm to be asked in the inquiry room in a public session. It argued those restrictions should include the identity of any person under investigation; evidence relating to the opinion of any government official concerning PPE Medpros contracts; and evidence about payments to the company and who ultimately benefited. In its submission, it said there was a realistic possibility that criminal charges against one or more individuals will flow from the investigation. The Department of Health later asked for the terms of any restriction order to be widened to include any financial material and correspondence relating to the purchase of PPE from the company, although that request has been rejected by the inquiry. In her final ruling, Baroness Hallett said it was both necessary and proportionate for the Covid inquiry to examine contracts between the government and PPE Medpro. But she did accept there was a risk of damage to any future criminal proceedings if she allowed all the evidence to be heard in public. As a result, any sensitive evidence about the company will be heard in a private, closed hearing, expected to be held in late March. She said the NCAs origina...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rkj8pv684o,2025-03-08
'I discovered my fat build-up condition after a Love Islander had it',"For years, Emma Griffiths was self-conscious about the fact her legs had grown out of proportion with the rest of her body. But it wasnt until she was watching Love Island one night that the nurse noticed contestant Shaughna Phillips had the same shape legs - and started doing some research. Experts online suggested Shaughna had lipoedema and amateur triathlete Emma then knew this is what I had, Im not just obese. The 35-year-old mother has now joined calls for more support to be available on the NHS for people with lipoedema. Lipoedema causes fat to abnormally build-up mainly in the hips, buttocks and legs, leading to a disproportionate shape. The exact cause of the chronic condition is unknown but it is not from being overweight. Lipoedema may be caused by changes in hormones and is believed to affect about one in 10 people worldwide - although many do not know they have it. Emma was about 11 when her legs started to feel heavy and throb and said they started to grow bigger. I was looking in the mirror and thinking theres something wrong here, why are my legs different to girls my age?, she recalled. Despite leading a healthy lifestyle and at one point losing five stone, Emmas bottom half remained bigger and she suspected something was wrong. I thought this is not responding to diet and exercise - something is going on here, said the mum-of-two from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire. If I hadnt had seen Shaughna Phillips on Love Island, I dont think I would have known that I had lipoedema... or at that point, had the diagnosis. I went to see the GP and he didnt know what I was talking about. Despite having some NHS support, Emma asked to be referred to a lymphoedema clinic and a private surgeon diagnosed her with stage two lipoedema in 2022. Liposuction surgery removed four litres of fat from her thighs and while Emma said it helped, she said it did not cure her condition. She now manages it through a healthy lifestyle, wearing compression stockings and dry brushing her skin. She says that helps with swelling and pain relief. Gemma Robinson has also struggled with lipoedema and before her surgery, her legs were estimated to weigh about 11 stone (70kg). The 45-year-old has spent almost 70k on eight surgeries over two years to have 86 litres of fat and excess skin removed. Every time I was going back to the clinic my legs were growing, said the mother-of-two from Cardiff. Gemma said at one point she was almost housebound and could only get around through the help of a pushchair or shopping trolley. Despite losing nine and a half stone, she said it was mainly from her top half. My mobility was decreasing and I was going to end up in a wheelchair with my children pushing me, she said.

Blumenthal: 'I thought the TV was talking to me',"TV chef and restaurateur Heston Blumenthal said being sectioned was the best thing to have happened as he opened up about his bipolar symptoms. The 58-year-old, who was diagnosed with the condition in 2023 after being admitted to hospital, told BBC Breakfast how he once hallucinated a gun on the table. This wasnt all the time, but it was getting greater and greater, and being sectioned was the best thing that could happen to me, he said. Blumenthal, who runs several award-winning restaurants, including the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, has now become an official ambassador for Bipolar UK. According to the charity, the mental health condition is an episodic disorder characterised by sometimes extreme changes in mood and energy which has the highest risk of suicide of any mental health condition. I laughed out loud after receiving a message from a woman who told me that during a manic episode she thought the TV was talking to her, Blumenthal, who also has ADHD, said. The reason I laughed out loud was because I experienced the same thing. The chef said it was really difficult for his wife, French businesswoman Melanie Ceysson, who he married in 2023. She had to decide how I would take it being sectioned and ... my response was, I embraced it, but I never thought I was going to be diagnosed as being bipolar, I thought at the time, the highs and the lows were normal, but they werent. And they werent right for me, and they werent right for the people around me that ... cared for me. The NHS says a person can be detained, also known as sectioning, under the Mental Health Act and can be treated without their agreement if they need urgent treatment for a mental health disorder and are at risk of harm to themselves or others. Famous for his experimental dishes such as snail porridge and bacon and egg ice cream, Blumenthal said medication initially dulled his culinary imagination. I was zombified - I had no energy at all. As my medications have been changed and my levels of self-confidence and self-awareness have gone up I realise my imagination and creativity is still there, he said. It was at levels that were so extreme before... looking back I can remember during my manic highs I was interrupting myself with ideas. He said someone recently asked him if there was a button I could press to turn off my bipolar - would I press it?, to which he replied, no, I wouldnt, because its part of me. He has since returned to the kitchen and said he was thinking more clearly. Bipolar UK estimates more than one million adults in the UK have the disorder, about 30 more than the number of people with dementia. But it is estimated at least 500,000 people are undiagnosed. Its an honour to have Heston onboard as an ambassador, Simon Kitchen, chief executive of Bipolar UK, said. We hope that his experience will encourage more people to seek help if they are struggling with their own diagnosis or are in the process of seeking one.

Are noise-cancelling headphones to blame for young people's hearing problems?,"Whether its the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local café, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day. But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts. This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesnt listen, zones out, or is a bit ditsy. Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I cant listen to where the noise is coming from. I know its the persons voice, I just cant really compute it quick enough, she said. After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words. Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasnt until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from. She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear, she said. It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the overwhelming noise. The cause of Sophies APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play. Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use. Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling. APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing. Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on. Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering. Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particular...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkjvr7x5x6o,2025-03-08
Clive Myrie: What I saw during my 24 hours at a London hospital,"Its just before 10:00 GMT at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. Raymond Dubbery is 81 and suffering from pneumonia. His hair thinning, hes frail and very thin. The skin hangs from his limbs. Transferred here from his care home, hes not eating much. The hope is he could be discharged soon, but he doesnt like his care home and doesnt want to go back. Dr Khai Lee Cheah, consultant in elderly care, holds his hand. Raymond tells her he wants to live somewhere hell be happy. I take your point completely, she tells Raymond. That your care home should be somewhere to live, and not just somewhere to die. Im spending 24 hours at the Royal Free for a glimpse of the challenges facing the NHS as it grapples with intense winter pressures. For patients like Raymond, who has no family, hospital staff have become social workers - a point of human contact at a time when the social care sector is under strain. Its a dilemma for the medical staff, with 15-30 of patients at the Royal Free medically fit to be discharged but unable to go home, for a myriad of reasons. The hospital has its own discharge team - whose job it is to safely get patients out of the door, to free up beds for new admissions. Just under 14,000 people who are medically fit are still in English hospitals and cant go home, through no fault of their own. At the Royal Free London Trust, there are 275 people occupying beds who dont need to, at three major sites. That makes up nearly 20 of all the beds the trust has. Faye Rogers, on the discharge team, has been on the phone with a removals company. Shes trying to get someone to visit the home of a patient to shift a wardrobe in the bedroom, to make space for an essential hospital bed. This is the kind of issue we have to deal with every day, she says. Sometimes a family member has the keys to a patients house, and theyve gone on holiday. Some patients forget the key code to their front door, so no one can get in. The problems are mundane and routine but make it difficult for people to be discharged and theyre a regular occurrence. Mid-afternoon is easily the quietest time during our 24 hours at the Royal Free, with some of the ambulance staff we come across cautioning that things will change as day turns to night. And they are right. From around 8pm, more and more patients turn up at AE, on foot and by ambulance. All the assessment bays where patients are triaged on arrival fill up quickly and are in constant use for the next five hours. That leads to a spillover into the corridors, with patients in wheelchairs, on hospital beds and gurneys filling all the available space. The wards on either side are full too. Its cramped and depressing - but a familiar scene in hospitals right across England. At around 10pm we come across Cathleen Hill whos 86, sitting in a wheelchair among those in the corridor. She has a facial injury and a bloody nose. She tells me she arrived at the hospital seven hours earlier. She has already seen a doctor but is now havi...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93lzygn3j1o,2025-03-08
"UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show","Boys born in the UK in 2023 can expect to live on average to the age of 86.7, and girls to 90, latest data suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says figures show a continued trend of longer life expectancy for men and women. The survival gap between the sexes is narrowing, partly down to men leading healthier lifestyles, experts say. Projections suggest more than one in 10 boys and one in six girls born in 2023 will live to at least 100 years old. The ONS report is based on the most up-to-date survival figures for 2023, and makes predictions for the future based on trends and projections. For example, one in four baby girls and nearly one in five baby boys born in 2047 might expect to live to 100. Overall, men born in 2047 could have a life expectancy of 89.3 years, and women 92.2 years. The estimates could change though, and the life expectancy figures are for populations - they do not mean that each individual person will live into old age. Men aged 65 years in the UK in 2023 can expect to live, on average, a further 19.8 years. For women who were 65 in 2023, the figure is 22.5 more years of life. Projections suggest that by 2047, this could to rise to 21.8 more years of life for 65-year-old men and 24.4 more years for mid-60s women. Kerry Gadsdon from the ONS said the statistics show that the life expectancy gap between men and women is closing, and has been for decades. This is likely due to improvements in lifestyle, for example reduction in smoking rates and the working conditions of men over several decades, as well as advances in healthcare, for example the prevention and treatment of heart disease. The gap is projected to be down to 2.5 years by 2072.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgl6z423jeo,2025-03-08
Surgeon suspended after children hurt by treatment,"A specialist surgeon has been suspended from a world-renowned NHS hospital after children under their care were left with lasting injuries. A review was commissioned at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, after concerns were raised by the surgeons colleagues in October. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said an independent expert found operations involving nine children fell below expected standards on several occasions over the past two and a half years. The trusts chief executive Roland Sinker said: We are very sorry that this has happened and we apologise unreservedly to our patients and their families. Addenbrookes is the East of Englands designated major trauma centre. The review, completed in January, analysed a number of complex paediatric hip surgery cases performed at the hospital. It found some of the childrens quality of life had been affected, including their mobility. The procedures in question did not result in amputation, but some of the children required further surgery they otherwise would not have needed, the trust said. The doctor was put on restricted duties while the investigation took place. They were suspended after the review and were fully co-operating with the trusts process, Mr Sinker said. A helpline was made available for parents who were concerned about the treatment their children had received. The trust has also been contacting the patients and their families to schedule appointments and undergo further clinical assessments where required. Mr Sinker said: We take this matter extremely seriously and are committed to ensuring all affected patients and families receive appropriate care and support. The hospital trust contacted the General Medical Council, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission in light of the review. We will identify whether there were any opportunities to have identified these concerns earlier as well as any wider learning and changes required in the immediate and longer term, Mr Sinker added. He said a further review was planned looking at all the operations undertaken by the surgeon during their employment at the trust. It is the second NHS hospital performing complex surgery to have reviewed the work of a paediatric surgeon in the past six months. In September, Great Ormond Street Hospital in central London reviewed the cases of about 700 children after concerns about one of its doctors.

"Fifty countries affected by USAID freeze, says WHO","Programmes to tackle HIV, polio, mpox and bird flu have been affected by the freeze on tens of billions of dollars of overseas aid from the US, says the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). US President Donald Trump has taken steps to close the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that its spending is totally unexplainable. However, WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged the Trump administration to consider resuming aid funding until other solutions can be found. HIV treatments and other services have been disrupted in 50 countries, he said at a briefing on Wednesday. Speaking publicly for the first time about the freeze on US aid funding, at a virtual press conference in Geneva, Dr Tedros said: There are actions that the US government is taking... which were concerned are having a serious impact on global health. In particular he pointed to the suspension of PEPFAR, the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which he said had halted HIV treatment, testing and prevention services in 50 countries. He added that a reprieve for life-saving services had not stopped the disruption. Clinics are shuttered and health workers have been put on leave, Dr Tedros said. Experts in global health have warned of the spread of disease, as well as delays to the development of vaccines and new treatments as a result of the cuts. Trump has argued that USAID is incompetent and corrupt. He recently announced huge cuts to the agencys 10,000-strong workforce and the immediate suspension of almost all of its aid programmes. The agency spends about 40bn (32bn) - about 0.6 of total US yearly government spending - on humanitarian aid, much of which goes towards health programmes. The vast majority of USAID money is spent in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, where it is primarily used for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who is working on the White Houses effort to shrink the size of the federal government, has previously claimed that the aid agency is a criminal organisation. Neither Trump nor Musk have provided clear evidence to support their claims. As well as the freeze on USAID, President Trump has taken steps to withdraw the United States from the WHO. Under the Biden administration the US was the largest funder of the UNs health agency and in 2023 it contributed almost one-fifth of the agencys budget. Dr Tedros said Trumps decision was affecting collaboration between countries on global health threats. He also said the US had reduced its reporting of bird flu cases in humans. The WHO says it has employed emergency measures similar to those used during the Covid pandemic to fill the gaps where there are shortages - in life-saving antiretroviral medication, for example, which is used to treat people living with HIV. Meg Doherty, director of global HIV, hepatitis and sexually-transmitted infection (STI) programmes at the WHO, said efforts were being made to co-ordinate the sharing of ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj3z290ngyo,2025-03-08
How does the Covid inquiry work?,"The Covid inquiry is taking evidence from politicians, civil servants and health experts about the roll-out of vaccines and anti-viral treatment across the UK. In July 2024, the inquirys first report said the UKs flawed pandemic preparations had led to more deaths and greater economic damage than there should have been. Just under 227,000 people died in the UK from Covid between March 2020 and May 2023, when the World Health Organization said the global health emergency was over. The Covid inquiry was launched by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, more than a year after he said the governments actions would be put under the microscope. The announcement came after the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign said it was considering launching a judicial review over government time-wasting. Johnson said the inquiry would cover decision-making during the pandemic by the UK government, as well as the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first public hearings took place in London in June 2023. Subsequent hearings have been held in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Public inquiries are established and funded by the government and are led by an independent chair. They can compel witnesses to give evidence. No-one is found guilty or innocent, but the inquiry publishes conclusions and recommendations, which the government is not obliged to accept. Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers The inquiry is chaired by former judge and crossbench peer Baroness Hallett, who previously led the inquests into the 7 July London bombings. She said that loss and suffering would be at the heart of the inquiry, adding it would be firmly independent. Baroness Hallett promised the inquiry would be thorough and fair Baroness Hallett said the inquiry would examine how decisions on limiting the spread of Covid were made and communicated; the use of lockdowns and face coverings; and the impact on children, health and care sector workers, and the clinically vulnerable. She will also consider the effect on bereaved families, and how the findings could be applied to other national emergencies. Loss and suffering at heart of Covid inquiry Several reports are expected, covering everything from political decision-making to vaccines. Publishing the first of these in July 2024, Baroness Hallett said the UK was ill-prepared for dealing with a catastrophic emergency, let alone the coronavirus pandemic. Never again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering, she added. The 217-page report, external argued the UK planned for the wrong pandemic - a mild one where spread of a new virus was inevitable - and this led to the untested policy of lockdown. It said the UK government and devolved nations failed their citizens, and that ministers did not sufficiently challenge scientific experts. It made a series of recommendations for reforming the way the government approaches emergency planning across the four nations of t...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-57085964,2025-03-08
Large UK-wide pandemic preparedness tests planned this year,"Emergency service teams, local councils and government officials will take part in a full, multi-day pandemic preparedness exercise, to help the UK prepare for potential future threats. The test, which is likely to take place in the autumn, will involve thousands of people across different parts of the UK, minister Pat McFadden has announced. The plans come in response to the first set of recommendations made by the Covid-19 Inquiry - the ongoing public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The chair of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, found the UK was ill-prepared for the coronavirus pandemic, and failed its citizens. The national pandemic response exercise will be the first of its kind in nearly a decade, designed to test capabilities, plans and procedures in the face of new threats, the government says. The findings and lessons will be made public, as requested by Baroness Hallett, who made a series of recommendations in a 217-page report published in July 2023. Another measure will be a full test of the emergency alert system - which sounds an alarm through mobile phones - later this year. The alert has been used four times since its launch in 2023, including in areas hit hardest by recent storms. The government has also committed to training 4,000 people a year to be better prepared for crises such as pandemics, through a UK resilience academy, planned to open in April. The Covid-19 inquiry report found the pandemic had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups. A new national vulnerability map will be produced, Mr McFadden says, to highlight populations who may be vulnerable in a crisis, using data on age, disability, ethnicity and whether someone is receiving care. It is designed to help people get more targeted local support. Mr McFadden said: We must learn lessons from the Covid pandemic, as we cannot afford to make the same mistakes again. But we will plan in a way that recognises the next crisis may not be the same as the last. Pandemic planning and resilience are also about making sure the underlying fundamentals of the country are strong, he added. Baroness Halletts first report called for a major overhaul of the systems involved in preparing the country for civil emergencies. It also pointed out the UK lacked resilience, with high rates of ill-health and public services running close to - if not beyond - capacity.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj910k8g4l0o,2025-03-08
Families failed by Covid jabs tell inquiry of pain,"Families of those harmed by Covid vaccines told the UK Covid Inquiry they were forced to support each other during the pandemic because there was no other help. Kate Scott, who represents the group Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK (VIBUK), said they felt they were almost being pushed into the shadows during the pandemic. The inquiry also heard from a victims group in Scotland which raised concerns that the vaccine had been rolled out too quickly, and that safety had been sacrificed for speed. This is the Inquirys fourth module, which will consider issues relating to the development of Covid-19 vaccines and their implementation. Mrs Scott, whose husband Jamie was left severely disabled by a vaccine, said: We are an uncomfortable truth, but we are a truth and the truth is for everyone in our group - the vaccine caused serious harm and death. Jamie Scott, a father of two boys, worked in a high-powered job until he was severely injured by a Covid vaccine. He spent four weeks and five days in a coma and suffered an extremely rare, life-threatening side effect called VITT, or vaccine-induced immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Jamie survived, but suffered a significant brain injury, which affected his thinking processes. He is now partially blind and his wife says he will never live independently. Jamie has received 120,000 - the maximum payout from the governments Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. His wife, who is clear that neither of them is against vaccines, says he will never work again and that this is not a fair or adequate amount. The scheme is inadequate and inefficient - offers too little too late and to too few, she said. The inquiry heard that figures from a Freedom of Information request by VIBUK show that, as of 30 November 2024, victims and their families have made 17,519 claims to the scheme. Of these: Covid Inquiry chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett spoke with a trembling voice as she told Jean Rossiter, whose son Peter died after contracting Covid-19: I too am the mother of two sons of a similar age to Peter, so I can only imagine the pain and the grief that you are going through. Peter Rossiter was a highly talented, classical pianist who brought music to life while head of music in a school, Jean told the inquiry. However, despite being a key worker, he only received his first vaccine in May 2021 - five months after the first jab was given in the UK. That summer he was infected with Covid and became seriously ill, was admitted to intensive care in hospital but died on 11 August 2021. Peter had kept himself fit, said his mother Jean who helped set up the group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK. He followed the rules, we all did and it seems to us as parents that we did everything right and yet Peter lost his life still, as did so many of the families whore in our group, she said.

NHS hours from PPE running out in Covid - Hancock,"The NHS in England came within six or seven hours of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said. The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems. He stated there was never a national shortage of PPE for healthcare workers but in some places, they did run out - and it was awful. Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to learn the lessons of what went wrong and put in place better stockpiles for the future. Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations. On Thursday, the inquirys chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives. Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid. In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was petrified newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care. But while some hospitals in England came under extraordinary pressure, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added. Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020. Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Downs syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was left to die because of her disability. Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic. Of course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences, he said. He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times. But he added: What we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, people, according to these characteristics, arent going to be cared for. Thats what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control. Did people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic, he told the inquiry. Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said on balance he believed the government got the rules about right.

Covid inquiry told Treasury blocked NHS bed request,"Boris Johnsons government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said. Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been very disappointing. Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and build resilience going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said. The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress. Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covids impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK. Ms Pritchard served as NHS Englands chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021. In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020. The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients. But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime ministers private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector. And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021. She called the decision very disappointing, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in quite a different position today had the extra funding been agreed. If we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally, Ms Prichard said. In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals. That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of extreme pressure in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country. By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers. But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed to the brink and were right on the edge of running out of bed space. Nationally, the health service had never had to systematically limit access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said. That does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpwz3qyr0o,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry told top NHS doctor was terrified,"The most senior doctor in NHS England has said he was personally terrified that hospitals could have been overwhelmed in the early stages of the pandemic. Prof Sir Stephen Powis told the Covid inquiry officials had drawn up a draft document advising whose care should be prioritised if the NHS found itself unable to cope with the surge in patients. The Covid-19 decision tool assigned points based on a patients age, frailty and underlying conditions. A high score meant they might not be admitted to intensive care if services were overwhelmed. The tool was never issued publicly, after it became clear infections might have already reached a peak in March 2020. Sir Stephen, who still serves as national medical director at NHS England, said the senior clinicians who were asked to draw up the plans at short notice did a magnificent job that nobody ever wants to do. But it became absolutely clear to me that this was going to be controversial, and that it hadnt had the opportunity to be discussed more widely with patient groups, or with the public, he added. The draft document advised doctors to score Covid patients based on three criteria, using a frailty scale. It detailed how those with a total score of more than eight points should not be admitted to intensive care if services became overwhelmed. Patients aged 70 to 75 were to be automatically assigned four points, while those aged over 80 would receive six. Extra points would be added for chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes. People who were terminally ill, with a life expectancy of less than six months, would automatically be given nine points. Sir Stephen said work on the guidance document had started early in the pandemic, at a time when the number of patients in intensive care in England was doubling every 5-7 days. It was not clear that the public would respond to lockdown - they did wonderfully - but that wasnt clear at that point, he said. Frankly, I was personally terrified that the NHS was going to be overwhelmed. The project was halted on 28 March 2020, after it became clear the peak of the first Covid wave was approaching and the health service would not breach capacity. Sir Stephen said there was also a danger the point-scoring system could have been used inappropriately, replacing the individual clinical judgement of doctors. My recommendation to the inquiry is that we should absolutely, in the future, not try and develop one of these tools in the midst of a pandemic, he added. He said it was a piece of work that needed to be carried out in consultation with the public in normal times. In my view, its a discussion that shouldnt be government-led, it shouldnt even be led by the profession, it needs to be located within society.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0gdzdv53yo,2025-03-08
How close were hospitals to collapse in Covid?,"Five times Prof Kevin Fong broke down in tears in a nondescript hearing room in West London, while giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. The 53-year-old has the kind of CV that makes you pay attention: a consultant anaesthetist in London who also works for the air ambulance service and specialises in space medicine. In 2020, as Covid spread around the world, he was seconded to NHS England and sent out to the worst hit areas to support other medics. Weve long been told that hospitals were struggling to cope during the pandemic. In January 2021, then prime minister Boris Johnson warned the NHS was under unprecedented pressure. But now many hours of testimony to the Covid inquiry this autumn is offering our clearest understanding yet of what was really going on at the height of the pandemic. The inquiry restarts its live hearings this week with evidence from doctors and patient groups. Health ministers and senior NHS managers are also expected to appear before the end of the year. I was at the inquiry the day Prof Fong calmly talked through more than 40 visits he led to intensive care units, his voice cracking at times. What Prof Fong discovered at the hospitals he visited was something he said could not be found in the official NHS data or the main evening news bulletins at the time. It really was like nothing else Ive ever seen, he said. These people were used to seeing death but not on that scale, and not like that. In late 2020, for example, he was sent to a midsize district hospital somewhere in England that was bursting at the seams. This was just as the second wave of Covid was hitting its peak. England was days away from its third national lockdown. The first vaccines were being rolled out but not yet in large numbers. In that hospital, he found the intensive care unit, the overflow areas and the respiratory wards all full with Covid patients. The previous night someone had died in an ambulance outside waiting to be admitted. The same thing had happened that morning. The staff were in total bits. Some of the nurses were wearing adult nappies or using patient commodes because there wasnt time for toilet breaks. One told him: It was overwhelming, the things we would normally do to help people didnt work. It was too much. That night, Prof Fong and his team helped to transfer 17 critically ill patients to other NHS sites  an emergency measure unheard of outside the pandemic. It is the closest I have ever seen a hospital to being in a state of operational collapse, he said. It was just a scene from hell. In the pandemic we heard reports of swamped hospitals in danger of being overwhelmed though to what extent was never fully clear. On the face of it bed occupancy in England  thats the total number of hospital beds taken up by all patients  did not hit more than 90 in January 2021, the peak of the largest Covid wave. Thats above the 85 level considered safe but not any higher than a typical winter outside the pandemic. That doesnt tell the full st...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78dl0xv7y2o,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry told of trust do-not-resuscitate rule,"At least one NHS trust put in place a blanket do-not-resuscitate order for sick patients in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has heard. It would mean individuals were considered ineligible for potentially lifesaving CPR, solely on the basis of age or disability, without being individually assessed. Former Resuscitation Council UK president Prof Jonathan Wyllie said he knew of one trust implementing the policy, although he had not seen a document setting it out. Groups representing the families of people who died from Covid said they were horrified but not surprised. Under NHS guidance, a Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNCPR) order can be added to someones medical notes after consultation with the patient or their family members. It means medical staff will not attempt chest compressions or defibrillation, where an electric shock is applied to restore normal heart rhythm, if the patients heart or breathing stops. Only 15-20 of those who have CPR in hospital survive, with success rates dropping to 5-10 outside of a hospital setting. Groups representing bereaved families believe some hospital departments became so overwhelmed in the pandemic that blanket DNACPR rules were applied, based solely on age, disability or medical condition. At the time, the charity Mencap said some people with learning disabilities had reported being told they would not be resuscitated if taken ill with Covid. NHS England says a blanket DNACPR rule for every person with a specific medical condition or over a certain age would be unlawful. It wrote to NHS trusts a number of times during the pandemic, to remind clinicians the orders should only ever be applied with the appropriate consent. Prof Wyllie told the inquiry he had not seen a document from the NHS trust concerned but had heard about the policy from a fellow member of the Resuscitation Council. The charity, which develops guidelines and training for medical staff, had then released a very clear public statement that blanket DNACPR orders were not an appropriate way forward and should not be implemented. That was our stance and that has never changed, Prof Wyllie added. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said the use of blanket policies would be irrefutable evidence some NHS services had been overwhelmed in the pandemic. The inquiry has heard repeatedly from those at the top that blanket DNACPRs were not appropriate and that there was no directive in place, the groups solicitor Nicola Brook said. The bereaved families have known for a long time that the realities on the ground were very different. Their worst fears have now been confirmed but this brings with it more questions, If it happened at this trust, did it happen at the trust where my loved one was?",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd98vpxgp7ko,2025-03-08
"We were not treated as parents, Covid inquiry told","A mother of premature twins has told the Covid inquiry she did not feel like she was treated as a parent after giving birth in the early stages of the pandemic. Tamsin Mullen said she was kept in a side room for 27 hours after giving birth by caesarean section while her sons were taken to neonatal intensive care. She said rigid visiting restrictions meant that, for the next month, only one parent was allowed to visit her newborn babies at a time. We needed the hospital to understand we were a family, she told the inquiry. We didnt feel like a mother and father to our children in the way we should have done. The Covid inquiry has been taking evidence about the impact on maternity services as part of its third section, or module, which is investigating the impact on the NHS and healthcare. Ms Mullen, a mother of three, was giving first-hand impact evidence on behalf of 13 pregnancy, baby and parent organisations. She found out she was expecting twin boys in 2019 and was considered high-risk. When pregnant with her first child, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia - a condition which can cause high blood pressure and lead to serious complications. Her pregnancy was being monitored closely with scans every week because of concerns about the development of one of the babies. Initially she said her husband was able to come with her to scanning appointments, but as Covid spread in March 2020, he was forced to wait in the car park outside after driving 50 miles from their home to the nearest hospital. It was just before the first lockdown came into effect, she said. I was very nervous. It was very difficult to do that alone knowing the pregnancy was high-risk. In April 2020, Ms Mullens two sons were born prematurely, at 34 weeks, by caesarean section. Her husband was able to be with her in the operating theatre and then in the recovery room for an hour, before being told Covid restrictions meant he had to leave. Their two young boys then spent a total of 31 days in neonatal intensive care before they could be discharged. Ms Mullen said Covid restrictions meant only one parent could be with them at a time, even after they had been moved to a single room away from other babies. The hospital had shut off access to side rooms used for breastfeeding and Ms Mullen said she was told to use a toilet to express milk, something she did not want to do because of the infection risk. She said the restrictions were baffling when both parents lived together and were driving to hospital each morning in the same car. She was looking after both babies by herself in intensive care when hospital staff from outside the unit told her they had tested positive for a bacterial infection called MRSA. I was holding our son who was on oxygen at the time, she said. I was in a state of shock so didnt really say very much. They the staff left me and I was there on my own. I didnt know what it all meant, so I really panicked. Later a doctor explained the form of MRSA involved was a less...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70z1ppyv5eo,2025-03-08
Covid ambulance crews faced 'crucial PPE delays',"Ambulance crews faced crucial delays trying to save dying patients in the pandemic because of the time it took to put on protective equipment, the Covid inquiry has been told. Ambulance technician Mark Tilley appeared close to tears when he described how the experience still played on his mind. I bottle things away. Im told quite a lot of times Im cold. I just deal with it in the way that I deal with it, he said. During the pandemic, some ambulance staff moved into budget hotels for weeks at a time to avoid putting family members in danger, he added. Mr Tilley, who works for South East Coast Ambulance Service, was giving evidence as a representative of the GMB union. In January 2021, at the peak of the winter wave of the pandemic, he volunteered to move to Sittingbourne, in north Kent, for three weeks, along with 40 colleagues. A new variant of Covid which appeared to transmit more quickly had recently emerged in the area, and hospitals were coming under increased pressure. He told the inquiry that, on one occasion, he had to queue in his ambulance outside AE for an entire ten-hour shift because there was not enough room to transfer a heavily deteriorating patient into the building. Wed run out of oxygen, so wed had to scan the hospital to try and find more, he said. We ordered pizza to the vehicle because otherwise we wouldnt have had anything to eat. Because of lockdown rules at the time, volunteer ambulance crews were sleeping in a budget hotel, with some deciding not to return home to avoid placing family members in danger. You had nowhere to go, so it was just the facilities that were there: the television and a phone, he said. You had 12 hours after your shift to mull over what youd been seeing; the queues at the hospital, the poor patients. In his testimony, Mr Tilley described arriving at residential homes where patients were dying inside the front window or on the pathway. Under guidance, paramedics and other ambulance staff were told they had to wait until arriving at the scene before they could put on plastic Tyvek suits and protective hoods or masks. He said that could cost crews a crucial minute and a half before they were able to start treatment: I would have normally gone over and started bouncing up and down on their chest to perform CPR. But instead we went and got our masks and suits on and all of that  that plays on my mind all the time. For me, you cant change history no matter what you talk about, its history. We cant change it. Counsel to the inquiry Alice Hands said research commissioned by the inquiry had revealed similar accounts, with other ambulance crews saying they were forced not to intervene and watch people die while they put on equipment. In his evidence, Anthony Marsh, national ambulance adviser to NHS England and former chairman of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said he was aware of those concerns at the time and did raise the matter with senior colleagues. But he said allowing crews to put on PP...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw0vrrqnno,2025-03-08
"Covid was like a daily terror attack, doctor tells inquiry","Treating patients during the pandemic was like responding to a daily terror attack, the Covid inquiry has heard. Giving testimony, Professor Kevin Fong, spoke of staff he met during a hospital visit being in total bits. The former national clinical adviser in emergency preparedness at NHS England recalled a conversation with an intensive care doctor during a visit in December 2020. I asked him immediately what things had been like and Ill never forget, he replied its been like a terrorist attack every day since it started, and we dont know when the attacks are going to stop. Prof Fong described Covid as the biggest national emergency this country has faced since World War Two, and repeatedly broke down in tears on the stand while describing what he had seen and his conversations with other staff members. During the pandemic, Prof Fong, a consultant anaesthetist, conducted around 40 visits of the hardest hit intensive care units on behalf of NHS England to offer peer support to the doctors and nurses working there. He wrote reports which were sent back to senior managers including Englands chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. He said the scale of death was very difficult to capture in the figures. It was truly, truly astounding We had nurses talking about patients raining from the sky, where one of the nurses told me they got tired of putting people in body bags. We went to another unit where things got so bad they were so short of resources, they ran out of body bags and instead were stuck with nine-foot clear plastic sacks and cable ties. These are people who are used to seeing death but not on that scale and not like that. Prof Fong said that despite the best efforts of everyone in the system the surge of demand for healthcare caused by Covid meant it was not possible to deliver the standard of care that would ordinarily be expected. He described the situation as the worst he had witnessed: I was on the scene of the Soho bombing in 1999, I worked in the emergency department during the 7th July suicide bombing with the helicopter medical service. And nothing I saw during all of those events was as bad as really Covid was every single day for every single one of these hospitals through the pandemic surges. Its painful now because it was very clear what was happening to the patients, it was very clear what was happening to the staff. The staff were very injured by just how overwhelmed they were by the whole thing. In December 2020 as Covid rates were rising again across the UK, he said he was asked to visit an unnamed hospital with a medium-sized intensive care unit. Ill never forget it, he said. It was a scene from hell. This was a hospital in massive, massive trouble.... there were so few staff that some of the nurses had chosen to either use the patient commodes or wear adult diapers because there was literally no one to give them a toilet break, he added. This was a hospital breaking at the seams. At the end of his evidence, he was tha...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9py388z17o,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry rejects clinicians’ anonymity plea,"The chair of the Covid inquiry has refused an application from the UK Health Security Agency to keep the identities of two junior clinicians secret. Lawyers for UKHSA applied for an order preventing publication of their names, on the grounds they could be subject to abuse and harassment on social media and in person. Both individuals attended Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Cell meetings to discuss the guidance on masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Baroness Hallett ruled their names could be published in minutes of those meetings, as any risk was outweighed by the public interest in reporting on the groups work. From February 2020 until it was disbanded in 2022, guidance on the use of PPE in healthcare settings was drawn up by the IPC Cell, a group of clinicians and officials from the NHS, government and public-health bodies such as Public Health England, which then Health Secretary Matt Hancock replaced with UKHSA in 2021. Critics have said the IPC Cell was too slow to strengthen its recommendations on PPE after it became clear Covid could be spread by tiny airborne particles. The Covid-19 Airborne Transmission Alliance (CATA), a group made up of healthcare organisations and individuals which campaigned for stronger guidance, has called it a shadowy organisation with unclear accountability structures. UKHSA said the heated and aggressive public discourse around the subject meant there was a high likelihood junior members of staff could face online abuse if they were named in minutes published by the inquiry. One social media post from 2022 accused the IPC Cell of having the blood of many innocent Covid victims on its hands, adding: We shall not forgive. We shall not forget. Another, from early 2022, called the group psychopaths, pure and simple. In her ruling, Baroness Hallett said she deprecated attacks and abuse of this kind on any public servant doing their job. But work of the IPC Cell was important to her investigation and the public should be able to assess the evidence in full, including the names and qualifications of those involved in meetings. On balance, I am not persuaded that there is an objective risk of harm or damage to the applicants should their identities be published, she said. Eight media organisations led by the Guardian newspaper had argued there was a public interest in knowing who had been involved in decision-making at the time. The abuse of scientists, medics and other officials involved in the pandemic response has been a theme running through the Covid inquiry. Last week, Englands chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, Dame Ruth May, spoke about the impact of pretty horrible comments online. Sometimes you have to make decisions, or be involved in decisions that mean that, on social media in particular, you are vilified, she said. In June 2023, Englands chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said in his evidence that abuse and threats aimed at independent scientists could ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07n8zp9zp0o,2025-03-08
Warning tax rises could force care homes to close,"Tax rises and higher staffing costs announced in the Budget could force some care homes to close, providers have warned. Social care will be hit by a hike in the rate of National Insurance contributions paid by employers as well as increases to the minimum wage. The sector welcomed an extra 600m in funding to local authorities for adult and childrens social care. But care groups said this would not be enough and would be wiped off instantly by increased staffing costs. The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to exempt social care from the rise in National Insurance. The party said the chancellor had provided extra funding for the NHS and other public sector organisations to cover the cost of the tax rise - but because the vast majority of care providers are private they would not benefit from this. Speaking to BBC Radio 4s World at One programme, Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirmed the NHS would be refunded for the rise in National Insurance contributions. However, pressed on whether private social care companies would still have to pay the increased rate, he pointed to the extra 600m allocated for the sector. The chancellor has taken into account those pressures when making funding decisions, he added. Care England, which represents adult social care providers, said without further support the sector was in unprecedented danger and the closure of services that were no longer viable was likely. It said the 600m in funding was a drop in the ocean compared to the staggering 2.4bn in rising costs associated with wage increases and employer national insurance contributions. Mike Padgham runs five residential and nursing homes in North Yorkshire supporting older and disabled people. He has 210 staff, and his current wage bill is 5.3m a year. He estimates each month the increase in employers National Insurance will cost an extra 5,000, and the increase in the minimum wage will add another 25,000. Most of his residents are funded by the local authority and Mr Padgham says he will have to ask for higher fees. But care providers have long complained financially squeezed councils do not pay enough to cover the real costs of care. Mr Padgham, who chairs the Independent Care Group, which represents independent providers, said that as a labour-intensive sector an increase in employee costs was the last thing social care needed. For a lot of providers this will place existential pressure on them and could well push some out of business, unless it is matched by extra funding to those who commission care and there was little sign of that, he said. He said the extra 600m for social care would have little or no impact once shared between 152 local authorities and childrens services. He added: Any extra funding that might reach providers will be wiped off instantly by the increases in National Insurance and minimum pay which will together heap further pressure on social care providers.

"High-grade masks evidence weak, Covid inquiry told","There is only weak evidence that high-grade face masks better protected health workers than surgical ones in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has been told. Prof Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said respirator masks  known as FFP3s  may have performed no better than thin surgical masks in real-life situations. She said there could be significant harms from wearing tight-fitting FFP3s, including blisters and breathing difficulties. If the evidence was strong that FFP3s really protected people, and we saw a definitive reduction in infections, they would have been recommended, she said. Not all scientists agree on what has become a controversial issue. The BBC has previously reported on research which appears to show a significant real-world benefit from wearing higher-grade masks on hospital wards. Throughout the first two years of the pandemic, groups representing doctors, nurses and other health workers repeatedly called for urgent improvements to personal protective equipment (PPE), including the wider use of respirators. FFP3s are tight-fitting masks with a built-in air filter designed to block out tiny aerosol particles which can carry the virus. Before they can be used, each wearer must undergo a fit test, to make sure the mask is properly sealed to the face. For most of the pandemic, national guidance across the whole UK said that healthcare workers should wear basic surgical masks rather than FFP3s, except in intensive care or a small number of medical situations. The decision was heavily criticised by some staff with the doctors union, the BMA, calling it a matter of life and death. National guidance on face masks from April 2020 was drawn up by a group of experts from across the United Kingdom known as the IPC (Infection Prevention and Control) Cell. Its membership included representatives from the NHS, government departments and health bodies, including Public Health England (PHE), the organisation replaced by UKHSA in 2021 in a shake-up ordered by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock. The inquiry was shown minutes from an IPC Cell meeting on 22 December 2020, just after the new Alpha variant of Covid had been detected, which appeared to show disagreement about the use of higher-grade FFP3 masks. The records quote Dr Colin Brown, now the deputy director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA but at the time with PHE, as saying: Our understanding of aerosol transmission has changed. A precautionary approach to move to FFP3 masks in all healthcare settings whilst we are awaiting evidence should be advised. However, the wider IPC Cell decided that no upgrading of the guidance was warranted at the time, and NHS trusts were told to continue to supply staff with standard surgical masks in almost all cases outside intensive care. It was not until January 2022 that the advice changed, saying that FFP3 respirators should be available to all relevant staff depending on a risk assessment.

"Nurses bore the brunt of Covid, ex-chief nurse says","Nurses bore the brunt of the pandemic, with low staffing levels and difficulties accessing protective equipment, according to Englands former chief nurse. Dame Ruth May told the Covid inquiry the NHS had been understaffed in 2020, in part because of the catastrophic decision to cut financial support for student nurses in 2015. Resources had been stretched, particularly in intensive care, she said, with a knock-on effect on the care some Covid patients received. And she had been aware of widespread reports of problems supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) in March 2020, including a shortage of plastic gowns that had left front-line nurses living in fear. Dame Ruth, Englands chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, was one of the senior figures who appeared at Downing Street news conferences during the pandemic. She had also volunteered for nursing shifts during Covid, at times working under the radar in hospital wards, the inquiry heard. We were facing some extraordinarily difficult decisions in the very early part of pandemic, she said. It was a fast-moving environment - we were seeing a large number of cases coming in and deaths like we had never seen before. The NHS had entered the pandemic with about 40,000 nursing and midwifery vacancies in England, Dame Ruth said. And she criticised a catastrophic decision, in 2015, to replace the grant or bursary paid to student midwives and nurses with loans. It had led to reduction of about 5,700 trainees in England by 2020, Dame Ruth said, which would have made a difference in the pandemic. There would have been less burnout - there would have been less psychological impact, she said. Intensive-care units came under such pressure during Covid specialist critical-care nurses were responsible for up to six patients each instead of the usual one-to-one ratio. And Dame Ruth accepted that had affected the care patients received, saying: It was not where we wanted to go... and I know there have been consequences because of it. Blanket do-not-resuscitate orders had appeared to have been added to some patients records based on either their age or a pre-existing condition such as autism or a learning disability, she told the inquiry, which had been completely wrong. Dame Ruth also suggested it had been a mistake for some hospitals to prevent pregnant women from being accompanied by their partners during scans or the early part of labour. The faster rollout of Covid tests would have allowed visitors to come back into hospital earlier and been safer for staff and patients, she said. Dame Ruth also spoke about the pretty horrible online abuse she had faced at the time. The one thing I learned about the whole of this period, is the importance of integrity - and sometimes that comes at a cost, she said. That means on social media in particular you are vilified - but I wasnt the only one.

‘I grieve for the person I was before' - Covid inquiry to begin new phase,"The public inquiry into the pandemic will start 10 weeks of hearings on Monday looking at the impact on patients, healthcare workers and the wider NHS. Covid patients have been admitted to hospital more than a million times in the UK since the virus emerged in 2020, while countless others have had care for other conditions disrupted. The third stage of the inquiry will also examine the impact on NHS staff, the use of masks and PPE in hospitals, the policy of shielding the most vulnerable and the treatment of long Covid. And for the first time, the stories of more than 30,000 healthcare staff, patients and relatives will form part of the material entered into evidence. BBC News has spoken to some of them. It was absolutely horrendous. We were really struggling, having to scrounge around for masks and gloves, says Mandi Masters, a community midwife from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. At that early stage the NHS was, she says, working in the dark as the virus spread from China to Italy and then to the UK. Mandi later caught Covid herself  she is convinced at work  and ended up in hospital on oxygen for three weeks. My husband took me to AE but had to leave me there, turn around and walk away, she says. The news was coming out on how many health professionals were dying of Covid, but I was just too poorly to care at that point, she says. Looking back, I have to admit, it was extremely frightening. Mandi, 62, has now returned to work part-time, but still struggles to catch her breath after a short walk. Every cold or chest infection wipes her out and she grieves for the person I was before Covid. The third section of the Covid public inquiry will look in detail at the effect on healthcare workers. It will also cover: It has to examine the impact on the wider healthcare system, including the sharp increase in delays and waiting lists triggered by the pandemic. Lynda Ross, from Portadown, was booked in for spinal surgery in early 2020. Her operation was cancelled and, by the time she could see her specialist again, she was told it was too late for treatment. The consequence of that is I have to live my life in a level of pain that has me on the same medication as someone who is dying from cancer. she says. It feels like the rest of my life has been destroyed. More than 50 witnesses are expected to give evidence over the next 10 weeks, including scientists, medical experts, healthcare workers and politicians. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which represents more than 7,000 relatives, says it is deeply worried that only two of the 23 witnesses it has put forward have been called to appear.

Corruption review finds 'red flags' in more than 130 Covid contracts,"An anti-corruption charity says it has identified significant concerns in contracts worth over 15.3bn awarded by the Conservative government during the Covid pandemic, equivalent to one in every 3 spent. Transparency International UK found 135 high-risk contracts with at least three red flags - warning signs of a risk of corruption. Twenty-eight contracts worth 4.1bn went to firms with known political connections, while 51 worth 4bn went through a VIP lane for companies recommended by MPs and peers, a practice the High Court ruled was unlawful. A Conservative spokesperson said: Government policy was in no way influenced by the donations the party received  they are entirely separate. Transparency International UK analysed 5,000 contracts for red flags. The charity said its analysis also indicated that almost two thirds of high-value contracts to supply items such as masks and protective medical equipment during the pandemic, adding up to a total of 30.7bn, were awarded without any competition. A further eight contracts worth a total of 500m went to suppliers no more than 100 days old  another red flag for corruption. Normal safeguards designed to protect the process of bidding for government contracts from corruption were suspended during the pandemic. The government, led by Boris Johnson, justified this at the time by stressing the need to short-cut the bidding process to accelerate the supply of much-needed items such as personal protective equipment (PPE). But Transparency International UK, a core participant in the Covid-19 inquiry which begins its third module on Monday, said the suspension of normal safeguards was often unjustifiable, costing the public purse billions and eroding trust in political institutions. It is urging the authorities to investigate the high-risk contracts it has identified. The charity said it has written to the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee and Chancellor Rachel Reeves with a detailed overview of the findings and the contracts involved. Chief executive Daniel Bruce said: That we find multiple red flags in more than 15bn of contacts, amounting to a third of all such spending, points to more than coincidence or incompetence. He added that the Covid procurement response was marked by various points of systemic weakness and political choices that allowed cronyism to thrive, all enabled by woefully inadequate public transparency. As far as we can ascertain, no other country used a system like the UKs VIP lane in their Covid response. The cost to the public purse has already become increasingly clear with huge sums lost to unusable PPE from ill-qualified suppliers, Mr Bruce continued. We strongly urge the Covid-19 inquiries and planned Covid corruption commissioner to ensure full accountability and for the new government to swiftly implement lessons learned. Of a total of 48.1bn of public money spent on private sector contracts related to the Covid-19 pandemic, 14.9bn was written off by the Departme...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevj3y7n33vo,2025-03-08
How the UK planned for the wrong pandemic,"Even as Covid hit, the government and its health officials were bullish in their confidence about their ability to cope. Dr Jenny Harries, then the deputy chief medical officer for England, hailed the UK as an international exemplar in its preparedness at one of the early TV press conferences. She was not the only one who thought like this  after all, just a year before the pandemic a government review had praised our world-leading capabilities. But such a belief, said Baroness Hallett as she set out the first of her Covid reports, was dangerously mistaken. The UK had, in fact, prepared for the wrong pandemic. How did this happen? Across 217 pages and more than 80,000 words, Baroness Hallett has set out a detailed and damning critique of how a decade of over-confidence, wasted opportunities and muddled-thinking left the UK sleep-walking into a pandemic that went on to claim more than 200,000 lives and cause long-lasting damage to the economy and society. The initial cause of it can be traced back to 2009 and the swine flu pandemic. It was another virus that quickly swept the globe, but it turned out to be mild, partly because older people seemed to have some immunity because of previous exposure to a similar strain. Baroness Halletts report said that lulled the UK into a false sense of security. Two years later a new pandemic plan was produced. That strategy was not based on trying to heavily suppress the pandemic virus - instead it was about mitigating its inevitable spread in the belief the impacts would be mild. Because the strategy was based on flu, there was hope vaccines could be quickly deployed and, in the meantime, antiviral drugs could be used to lessen the severity of illness. But Covid was not flu  and certainly not a mild flu. The nine years from 2011 up to the start of the Covid pandemic are also littered with missed opportunities. The UK did not learn from east Asian countries like Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. They had used their experience of other coronavirus outbreaks, of Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and Sars (Severe acute respiratory syndrome), to put in place plans to quickly scale-up test and trace systems and introduce quarantine processes. Border control measures, including travel restrictions and testing, could also deployed. In contrast, the UK abandoned community testing in spring 2020 just as Covid was taking off. In his evidence for this module, Jeremy Hunt, who was health secretary from 2012 to 2018, went as far as to say that if we had learned from abroad we could even have avoided the first lockdown. But its not as if there was no attempt to learn lessons. In the 2010s, a number of training events were held, simulating both flu and coronavirus outbreaks, to stress-test the UKs preparedness. One event in 2016 called Exercise Cygnus identified worryingly large gaps in the response and plans were put in place to update those by 2018. But that did not happen, and by June 2020 just eight of the 22 recomm...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9472qxk1vo,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers,"Hearings have begun in the public inquiry, external scrutinising the UKs response to, and impacts of, the coronavirus pandemic. As the virus spread, government agencies increasingly published figures on case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths. To follow alongside the inquiry, the BBCs data team has broken down some of these statistics into key areas from the beginning of the pandemic up to 5 May 2023, when the World Health Organisation declared an end to the virus as a global health emergency, external. Just under 227,000 people died in the UK with Covid-19 listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. This includes those who had not been tested for the virus prior to their death. The most deaths reported in this way on a single day was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people were registered. At this point in the pandemic, the first variant of the virus seen in the UK - initially detected in Kent - was dominant. This was subsequently named the Alpha variant by the WHO. The UK was also only a month into the first stages of its vaccine rollout, which started to reduce the risk of death and serious illness from the virus. Another way of looking at the impact coronavirus had on the number of people dying in the UK is by counting all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began, sometimes referred to excess deaths, external. As of 5 May 2023, this was over 208,000 deaths. For most of the previous three years there were above average levels of deaths in the UK.

How inquiry is exposing deep flaws in Covid decision-making What to do if you have Covid: Can you go to work or school? The highest peaks in the first two years of the pandemic were during periods when many people died directly from Covid. Out of nearly 13,000 excess deaths in mid-April 2020, about 9,500 were attributed to the virus. But a larger portion of the excess seen in the second half of 2022 were driven by other factors, including flu and pressure on the NHS. Of the 3,300 excess deaths in mid-January 2023, about 600 were from Covid. Compared with other countries, over the three years to February 2023, the UKs death rates went up by more than 5, which was more than France, Germany and Spain (all up between 3 and 4.5), but by less than Italys (up more than 6). The US and Eastern European countries like Poland were even harder hit, with death rates more than 10 above their pre-pandemic levels over the three years to February 2023. More than 44 million people in the UK, external were estimated to have had the virus between April 2020 and February 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the most accurate measure available as the total number of infections across the country will never be known.

First place in British Isles set to approve right to die,"A law to give terminally ill adults on the Isle of Man the right to end their own lives is entering its final stages, making it potentially the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying. Anyone over the age of 18 and with a prognosis of 12 months or fewer to live would be eligible, under the legislation being debated in the Manx parliament. The bill will not be passed yet, since the Isle of Mans lower house has rejected an amendment that would have meant people would only need residency on the island for one year to take advantage of the legislation. The House of Keys continued to insist on five-year residency and have sent the legislation back to the upper house. The move comes as MPs in Westminster are scrutinising a bill that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. People on the Isle of Man eligible to request assisted dying would have to: The measures have been a matter of strong debate in Tynwald, the islands parliament. It is likely the bill will receive Royal Assent and become law, with the scheme possibly up and running by 2027. Jersey - a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man which can make its own laws - is also moving ahead with legislation to establish an assisted dying service. Former GP Dr Alex Allinson introduced the private members bill to Tynwald and has been pivotal in ushering it through the legislative process. He hopes this will be the last time it will need to be debated by the directly elected chamber. The passage of this bill has been a long and careful process starting in 2022 and has been properly consulted on, scrutinised and put through a full parliamentary process, Dr Allinson says. It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death. Among the key clauses in the most recent version of the bill are measures on age and length of prognosis. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, is currently being scrutinised by MPs in Westminster. If passed it would become law in England and Wales. It has some similarities to the Isle of Man legislation - people must be terminally ill, over 18 and registered with a GP. Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure. The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months. The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerlands Dignitas clinic. On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ed70qep7o,2025-03-08
Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people,"At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryans previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms. Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day. You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years, he says. Youd die. He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24, says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence. We have seen young people under the age of 25 whove completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal, says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou. In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024. And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11 of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4 in 2013 to 0.9 in 2023. The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities. And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine  also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is ofte...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0g2gnjrqo,2025-03-08
Assisted dying bill: What is in proposed law?,"MPs have voted in favour of proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will now face many more months of debate and scrutiny by MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament needed for it to become law. It is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all. The bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life. But there are requirements: Under the bill, a doctor could prepare the approved substance (the bill does not detail what medication this is) but the person themselves must take it. No doctor or anyone else would be allowed to administer the medication to the terminally ill person. The doctor would stay with the person until they had self-administered the substance and died (or the doctor determines the procedure has failed). The person could decide not to take it, in which case the doctor would have to remove the substance immediately. Doctors would also not be under any obligation to take part in the assisted dying process. This is called physician-assisted suicide. Voluntary euthanasia is different and is where a health professional administers the drugs to the patient. Deaths covered by the assisted suicide bill would not need to be investigated by a coroner. But the bill would make it illegal for someone to pressure, coerce or use dishonesty to get someone to make a declaration that they wish to end their life or to induce someone to self-administer an approved substance. If someone is found guilty of either of these actions, they could face a jail sentence of up to 14 years. Whats not included in the bill is how much the system would cost, who would pay and what the workload would be. And there is no detail about the judicial process - namely, how the evidence would be put before the High Court judge. Lord Thomas, former Lord Chief Justice, told the BBCs Today Programme that it cannot be a rubber stamping process and judges must be satisfied there is no coercion. The person seeking assisted dying would be advised to consider telling their family and GP, but would not legally have to. The law would apply to England and Wales. A separate bill is already under discussion in Scotland. Meanwhile, politicians in Jersey and the Isle of Man have already backed plans to introduce assisted dying and the process to bring in legislation is under way.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l7m6r55do,2025-03-08
'My first cervical screening was over before I knew it',"People not knowing about options to make their cervical screening easier and more comfortable is costing lives, a cancer charity warned last month. To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months. Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99 of cervical cancers. During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix. This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish theyd known beforehand. Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite. I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that, she says. When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more comfortable and casual, she says. Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening for at least two years because of concerns about pain. But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January. Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could. Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be uncomfortable and painful. But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didnt find this to be the case. Jessica Tse was really anxious before her cervical screening in December. I didnt know if it was going to hurt, she says. But the nurse was talking to me, distracting me throughout and explained the procedure really clearly, she adds. Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadnt felt before, Bianca recalls. But it was over before I knew, she says. Others say they didnt experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton. It was nothing, says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. I couldnt feel anything. She says the fact shed already had two children made her less anxious about the experience. These nurses have seen everything, Megan adds. Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says youre there to do a job, you dont care about these things. While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments.

How are the vaping rules changing?,"The government is tightening up the rules about how vapes are marketed and sold, alongside wider plans to tackle health issues caused by smoking. A ban on disposable vapes will also be introduced and a new tax on nicotine vapes put in place. The governments Tobacco and Vapes Bill proposes to outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship, external, and to restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products. Outdoor vaping may also be banned in smoke-free places, subject to consultation. Separately, the government had already announced that disposable vapes will be banned in England, Wales and Scotland from 1 June 2025. Northern Ireland is expected to follow suit. The move is designed to protect children and young peoples health, and to reduce environmental damage. It covers single-use vapes which cannot be refilled or recharged, external. Previous Conservative government plans to limit vaping and smoking had not become law by the time of the July general election, so Labour has brought in its own legislation. How will the UK smoking ban work? Vaping products are already subject to 20 VAT but, unlike tobacco, they do not attract a separate additional tax. As part of the Autumn Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that a vaping products duty will start on 1 October 2026. It will be charged at a flat rate of 2.20 per 10ml vaping liquid. At the same time, tobacco duty will be increased to preserve the financial incentive to switch to vaping. Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes. However, health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as it may cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains. The vapour inhaled contains a small amount of chemicals, often including the addictive substance nicotine. More research is needed to fully understand their health effects, but in December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that alarming evidence about the risks they pose was growing, external. Illegal vapes are also widely available and are much more likely to contain other harmful chemicals or drugs. Cigarettes contain tobacco, tar and a range of other toxic cancer-causing chemicals, and are one of the largest preventable causes of illness and death in the UK, external. That is why smokers are urged to stop, with nicotine vapes the most effective quit tool - better than nicotine patches or gum., external Research suggests people using vapes alongside face-to-face support can be up to twice as likely to stop smoking, external than those using other methods. But because vaping is not harmless, it is only recommended for adult smokers, who are offered free vape kits on the NHS to help them quit as part of its swap to stop programme.

Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines?,"There is nothing in life that is free of risk. That includes vaccines. But the evidence is compelling that the benefits of getting immunised with those vaccines recommended in the UK far outweigh the possibility of serious side effects. The level of benefit from Covid vaccines is well documented. And the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving more lives in the first year of its use than any other - 6.3m globally compared to 5.9m for PfizerBioNTechs jab. However, we need to discuss not just the huge positives that Covid vaccines brought, but also the small minority left injured or bereaved by the AstraZeneca vaccine. Around 50 families affected by rare blood clots have begun a group legal action for compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, arguing that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect. This includes people who have been left with severe physical injuries, those who are unable to work, and bereaved families who lost a loved one due to vaccine damage. They are a tiny fraction of all those vaccinated, but that is no comfort to the families affected, who feel like they have been airbrushed out of the pandemic and that their pleas for support have been ignored. Those families include Jane and Ian Wrigley from Buckinghamshire. Jane, 62, used to run, ski and climb mountains. Now she can barely walk due to extreme weakness down her left-hand side. Two weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021, Jane was admitted to hospital. She suffered blood clots in her brain and required emergency surgery to remove part of her skull. Janes medical records clearly state that she suffered these blood clots as a direct side effect of the vaccine. Her husband Ian is now her full-time carer. Jane told me: Before I had the vaccine I was a very independent, active woman doing half marathons and enjoying my life. Now Ive lost every bit of independence. Her case, and those of others affected by blood clots, raises serious questions about whether the system is letting down those who have suffered serious harm as a result of taking Covid vaccines. Almost 25m adults in the UK received a first dose of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine in 2021, and nearly all those had a second. It is estimated that the Covid vaccine programme prevented over a quarter of a million hospital admissions and over 120,000 deaths in the UK up to September 2021. The side effects of vaccination are usually mild and short-lived such as a sore arm, fever and fatigue. However, in the very rare event that something goes seriously wrong, we have a right to expect that we will be supported. This is a kind of social contract between individual and state. Thats where the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) comes in. The VDPS was established in 1979 in the wake of a scare over the safety of the whooping cough vaccine in use at the time. The government-backed scheme offers a one-off financial payment of 120,000 in the event that, on the balance of prob...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d5d6nng67o,2025-03-08
How will weight-loss drugs change our relationship with food?,"We are now in the era of weight-loss drugs. Decisions on how these drugs will be used look likely to shape our future health and even what our society might look like. And, as researchers are finding, they are already toppling the belief that obesity is simply a moral failing of the weak-willed. Weight-loss drugs are already at the heart of the national debate. This week, the new Labour government suggested they could be a tool to help obese people in England off benefits and back into work. That announcement - and the reaction to it - has held a mirror up to our own personal opinions around obesity and what should be done to tackle it. Here are some questions Id like you to ponder. Is obesity something that people bring on themselves and they just need to make better life choices? Or is it a societal failing with millions of victims that needs stronger laws to control the types of food we eat? Are effective weight-loss drugs the sensible choice in an obesity crisis? Are they being used as a convenient excuse to duck the big issue of why so many people are overweight in the first place? Personal choice v nanny state; realism v idealism  there are few medical conditions that stir up such heated debate. I cant resolve all those questions for you - it all depends on your personal views about obesity and the type of country you want to live in. But as you think them over, there are some further things to consider. Obesity is very visible, unlike conditions such as high blood pressure, and has long come with a stigma of blame and shame. Gluttony is one of Christianitys seven deadly sins. Now, lets look at Semaglutide, which is sold under the brand name Wegovy for weight loss. It mimics a hormone that is released when we eat and tricks the brain into thinking we are full, dialling down our appetite so that we eat less. What this means is that by changing only one hormone, suddenly you change your entire relationship with food, says Prof Giles Yeo, an obesity scientist at the University of Cambridge. And that has all sorts of implications for the way we think about obesity. It also means for a lot of overweight people there is a hormonal deficiency, or at least it doesnt go up as high, argues Prof Yeo, which leaves them biologically more hungry and primed to put on weight than someone who is naturally thin. That was likely an advantage 100 or more years ago when food was less plentiful  driving people to consume calories when they are available, because tomorrow there may be none. Our genes have not profoundly changed in a century, but the world we live in has made it easier to pile on the pounds with the rise of cheap and calorie-dense foods, ballooning portion sizes and towns and cities that make it easier to drive than walk or cycle. These changes took off in the second half of the 20th Century, giving rise to what scientists call the obesogenic environment - that is, one that encourages people to eat unhealthily and not do enough exercise.

"NHS needs better plan around weight loss jabs, warn experts","An urgent review is needed to make sure people in England can get weight loss jabs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro on the NHS, top experts warn. It comes a day after the prime minister said such injections could boost Britains economy by getting obese unemployed people back into work. More than 200 doctors and specialists have now written to the health secretary to say how stretched NHS obesity treatment services face unprecedented demand from patients wanting these drugs. They warn the injections are only part of what should be a wider package of non-stigmatising care. They say the government must fix some fundamentals issues in NHS obesity services - chronic underfunding, workforce challenges and unequal access to care. The letter to Wes Streeting is being sent by the Obesity Health Alliance (OHA), which represents health charities and medical royal colleges, and has compiled a report. It says some patients can wait up to five years for specialist support, and that some services are so overstretched they have closed their waiting lists entirely. The OHA wants to see equitable access for obesity treatments, including weight loss injections. There have been reports of global stock shortages and, currently in the UK on the NHS, the injections can only be offered through specialist weight-management services. Some patients go private, but many others miss out, warns the OHA. According to the OHA, about four million people in England are eligible for Wegovy, but NHS projections estimate that by 2028, fewer than 50,000 people a year would get the treatment. Katharine Jenner, director of the OHA, said the weight loss jabs were effective, but that was not the whole picture. Even if you are taking the jabs you still need to have extra care and support around it. You still need to be doing exercise and have dietary advice as well and thats not currently there. There is also concern about who is getting access to this drug. We need to make sure that we are prioritising access based on greatest clinical need and not based on any other factors. She added that the OHA had heard about people that had a right to access treatment services due to their excess weight being turned away. Theyre having to seek private treatment and theyre not getting the care and support package that theyd be expecting to get if you had any other sort of condition, she said. We need to have a review of existing NHS services to identify cases of really good best practice and identify those challenges that exist all over the place. The upcoming approval for the NHS to use another injection, called Mounjaro, dubbed by some as the King Kong of weight loss jabs for how well it appears works in trials, is expected to place even more pressure on the system, the report warns. Alfie Slade, government affairs lead at the OHA, said: The new weight loss drugs represent a breakthrough in treatment, giving hope to the millions of people struggling to manage their weight, but they also expose the weak...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y03p4xlx8o,2025-03-08
How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?,"The number of people taking ADHD medication is at a record high  and the NHS is feeling the strain as it tries to diagnose and treat the condition. Since 2015, the number of patients in England prescribed drugs to treat ADHD has nearly trebled, and BBC research suggests that it would take eight years to assess all the adults on waiting lists. Last year, ADHD was the second-most viewed condition on the NHS website. Concern about this rising demand has prompted the NHS in England to set up a taskforce. So whats going on and where will it end? Is ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) becoming more common? Are we just getting better at recognising it? Or is it being over-diagnosed? It turns out its not just you and I who have been taken by surprise  so have the experts. Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, the ADHD champion for the UKs Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: Nobody predicted that the demand would go up so massively over the last 15 years, and especially the last three years. Hes been running adult ADHD clinics since 2007. At the time, he says, there were just a few of them. ADHD is a fairly novel condition  its only 16 years since the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) officially recognised it in adults. When considering whether it might keep increasing, Dr Müller-Sedgwick argues that there are two different concepts to consider: prevalence and incidence. Prevalence is the percentage of people who have ADHD  Dr Müller-Sedgwick predicts that will stay pretty steady at 3 to 4 of adults in the UK. Incidence is the number of new cases  people getting a diagnosis. Thats where were seeing an increase. He explains: What has changed is the number of patients we are diagnosing. Its almost like the more we diagnose, the more word spreads. Prof Emily Simonoff echoes this. She is a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Kings Maudsley Partnership for Children and Young People. She thinks about 5 to 7 of children have ADHD in the UK  and says: Its pretty similar across the world, thats been consistent and it hasnt actually risen. Prof Simonoff agrees that theres been a steep incline in people coming forward for assessment since the pandemic  but says this comes after years of long-term under-recognition. She points to statistics on ADHD drugs. She would expect about 3 to 4 of children in the UK to need ADHD medication, but in reality, only 1 to 2 are actually using it. She thinks this shows that we are still underestimating the scale of the issue. Prof Simonoff explains: I think thats an important starting point for when we say, My goodness, why are we seeing all these children now  are we over-identifying ADHD? We have under-diagnosed or under-recognised ADHD in the UK for many, many years. In other words, we can expect more people to be diagnosed with ADHD now because services are playing catch-up.

The junior doctors' strikes may be over. But is trouble ahead?,"It had been the NHSs longest-running and bitterest pay dispute - responsible for hundreds of thousands of cancelled operations and appointments. And then, suddenly, word came on Monday that the British Medical Association was recommending that its 50,000 junior doctor members accept a fresh offer from the new government. It sounded almost too good to be true. And now some are wondering if it might be. Last Friday, just three days after formal negotiations started at the Department of Healths London headquarters, Health Secretary Wes Streeting laid his cards on the table. It was, he made clear to the British Medical Association delegation, a final offer - a pay rise topping 22 on average over two years in England. The unions team said they wanted to think about it over the weekend. On Sunday, the BMA junior doctor leaders met and decided that, while it fell short of their demand for a 35 pay increase, this was the best deal they could get. Cue much trumpeting from the government - in her appearance at the House of Commons, Chancellor Rachel Reeves paid tribute to work put in by the health secretary. Mr Streeting had met the BMA joint junior doctor leaders Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi several times before the election - asking them in their last meeting on Zoom to call off the strike they were about to hold in the lead-up to polling day. When he was made health secretary, Mr Streeting immediately called the BMA to set up talks. Two meetings were held with Dr Laurenson and Dr Trivedi in a 10-day period following his appointment - before the formal pay talks started. The health secretarys hand was helped by the fact the independent pay review bodys recommendations for the 2024-25 pay rise had just landed on his desk, suggesting a 6 pay rise and 1,000 lump sum be given. This allowed him to make an offer which effectively combined two years of pay rises. He topped up last years pay award - worth nearly 9 on average - with an extra 4 as well as agreeing to the pay review bodys recommendation for the current financial year. In less than a week of talks, the new health secretary had achieved what the previous government had failed to do over the course of 11 strikes in the previous 18 months. Whats important is it could be presented as a win-win for both sides, one source close to the talks said. The BMA got a big number, while the government only put in an extra 4 above what the pay review body recommended across the two years - that is just one percentage point more than what the Tories put on the table back in December when talks collapsed. Defending the deal, Ms Reeves called the costs - around 350m - a drop in the ocean compared to the 1.7bn cost of NHS strikes. That may all be true, but whats on offer to junior doctors has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the NHS. A pay rise of only 2 for NHS staff was budgeted for in the funding given to the health service this year. The Treasury has indicated it will cover some of the extra, but perhaps no...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19kdyyxzr3o,2025-03-08
Why we might never know the truth about ultra-processed foods,"They are the bête noire of many nutritionists - mass-produced yet moreish foods like chicken nuggets, packaged snacks, fizzy drinks, ice cream or even sliced brown bread. So-called ultra-processed foods (UPF) account for 56 of calories consumed across the UK, and that figure is higher for children and people who live in poorer areas. UPFs are defined by how many industrial processes they have been through and the number of ingredients - often unpronounceable - on their packaging. Most are high in fat, sugar or salt; many youd call fast food. What unites them is their synthetic look and taste, which has made them a target for some clean-living advocates. There is a growing body of evidence that these foods arent good for us. But experts cant agree how exactly they affect us or why, and its not clear that science is going to give us an answer any time soon. While recent research shows many pervasive health problems, including cancers, heart disease, obesity and depression are linked to UPFs, theres no proof, as yet, that they are caused by them. For example, a recent meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago was presented with an observational study of more than 500,000 people in the US. It found that those who ate the most UPFs had a roughly 10 greater chance of dying early, even accounting for their body-mass index and overall quality of diet. In recent years, lots of other observational studies have shown a similar link - but thats not the same as proving that how food is processed causes health problems, or pinning down which aspect of those processes might be to blame. So how could we get to the truth about ultra-processed food? The kind of study needed to prove definitively that UPFs cause health problems would be extremely complex, suggests Dr Nerys Astbury, a senior researcher in diet and obesity at Oxford University. It would need to compare a large number of people on two diets  one high in UPFs and one low in UPFs, but matched exactly for calorie and macronutrient content. This would be fiendishly difficult to actually do. Participants would need to be kept under lock and key so their food intake could be tightly managed. The study would also need to enrol people with similar diets as a starting point. It would be extremely challenging logistically. And to counter the possibility that people who eat fewer UPFs might just have healthier lifestyles such as through taking more exercise or getting more sleep, the participants of the groups would need to have very similar habits. It would be expensive research, but you could see changes from the diets relatively quickly, Dr Astbury says. Funding for this type of research could also be hard to come by. There might be accusations of conflicts of interest, since researchers motivated to run these kind of trials may have an idea of what they want the conclusions to be before they started. These trials couldnt last for very long, anyway - too many participants would most likely drop...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3pppw1z7o,2025-03-08
Are weight-loss injections the answer to obesity?,"Semaglutide is sold as Ozempic for use in diabetes and as Wegovy in weight-loss. You cannot escape the hype around weight-loss injections. Social media is full of before-and-after pictures. They are the source of wild gossip about Hollywood stars, and now the UKs National Health Service is going to pay for them. You can understand the appeal. Excess weight affects our health and leads to stigma - and the mantra of diet and exercise has simply failed for most people. But should we be calling semaglutide, the drug in question, a miracle or skinny jab when some doctors think it is as controversial as treatments get? Does the hype match the reality? Or are we failing to tackle the causes of obesity and just consigning people to a lifetime of medication? Jan, from Kent, was one of the first people in the world to take part in the trials of semaglutide. It is sold as Wegovy for weight-loss and as Ozempic for diabetes, although some people have been buying this version to lose weight. We all know somebody like Jan, who has tried every diet, and she has been battling her waistline her whole life. Semaglutide mimics a hormone that is released when we eat. It tricks the brain into thinking we are full and dials down appetite so we eat less. Once Jan started having the injections, her relationship with food was so transformational that she told me it was either down to the drug or Ive been abducted by aliens. For the first time she could go into a cafe, see some millionaires shortbread and not have her body screaming, I need one. Instead it was, I dont feel hungry... my body was saying you dont want it, it wasnt me using willpower, she says. The results of semaglutide are undeniable - at least for a while. On average, people who were obese lost about 15 of their body weight, external when taking semaglutide alongside healthy lifestyle advice in a trial. Note this is not a skinny jab - 15 takes you from 20 stone down to 17. That study showed the weight came off over the first year and then stabilised for the remaining three months of the trial. We do not know what happens when people take the drug for years. Jan lost 28kg (more than four stone). It meant she could finally enjoy her 60th birthday present - a flight in a Tiger Moth aeroplane, having been over the maximum weight limit before. I was flying in more ways than one, and boy did I enjoy it. Jan after a flight at Duxford Aerodrome in September 2019, which she says would have been impossible before her four-stone weight loss while taking semaglutide The results seem more compelling than your typical diet, which often starts well but then your depleted fat stores signal to the brain to seek food. That is why diets ultimately fail. More than 90 of people tend to end up back at the weight they were before they started on their dietary journey, says Prof Sir Stephen ORahilly, the director of the Medical Research Councils Metabolic Diseases Unit. He sees these drugs as the beginning of an exciting era where...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64677915,2025-03-08
What is assisted dying and how could the law change?,"Labour MP Kim Leadbeater says her bill includes the strictest safeguards anywhere in the world MPs voted in support of a proposal to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, in November 2024. Months of detailed scrutiny and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could become law. At present, laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, external was introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their life. It says that anyone who wants to end their life must: be over 18 and live in England and Wales, and have been registered with a GP for at least 12 months have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure be expected to die within six months make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed, about their wish to die satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible - with at least seven days between each assessment Once a patients application has been approved, they would then have to wait 14 days before proceeding. A doctor would prepare the substance being used to end the patients life, but the person would take it themselves. The bill defines the coordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with training, qualifications and experience at a level to be specified by the Health Secretary. It does not say which drug would be used. It would be illegal to use dishonesty, pressure, or to coerce someone into declaring they want to end their life, with a possible 14-year prison sentence. Under the original proposals, a High Court judge would have to approve each request to end a life. However, Leadbetter has suggested a panel of legal and medical experts should oversee applications instead. The panel would be chosen by a new Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission which would be led by a High Court judge or senior former judge. The proposal follows concerns that the High Court would not have capacity to rule on each individual case. However, some opponents have said the move undermines the bills safeguards. The change would need to be approved by the MPs scrutinising the bill. Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says Many months of activity lie ahead in the Commons and the Lords. There are 23 MPs on the committee reviewing the legislation line-by-line. They include 14 supporters - including two ministers - and nine opponents. The committee is holding public hearings and taking evidence from experts. It will then propose amendments to the bill. It is hoped that the committee process will be finished in time for the bill to return to the House of Commons on 25 April. At that stage, all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on the changes proposed by the committee. There would then be more scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords, and further voting. ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47158287,2025-03-08
