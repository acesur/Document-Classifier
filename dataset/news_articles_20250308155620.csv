Labour ministers yet to hold talks over Abramovich funds,"Labour ministers have yet to hold talks with key figures involved in unlocking the 2.5bn promised for Ukraine after Roman Abramovichs sale of Chelsea football club. Abramovich sold Chelsea in 2022, after he was sanctioned by the UK government over Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The 2.5bn raised was meant to be used for humanitarian causes linked to the Ukraine war but it remains frozen in a UK bank account. Labour ministers are coming under increasing pressure to meet Abramovichs representatives or the members of the foundation that was set up to manage the funds. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) told the BBC its officials are in talks with Abramovichs representatives. But multiple sources said there have been no meetings between any Labour ministers and members of the foundation set up to oversee the funds since the general election last year. Sources close to the foundation said there was a deadlock and a political decision by a minister is needed to negotiate and sign off an agreement that can break the impasse. One source said: For three years, the government has been saying its been working very hard to release the money. But they are not having meetings with the foundation. There has been no meeting with a minister since Labour took over, for example. The BBC understands the FCDO has acknowledged a request for a meeting between the foundations board and Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Abramovichs representatives did not wish to comment, but those with knowledge of the situation acknowledged little contact or progress had been made on releasing the funds under the four prime ministers to have held power since the sale of the club. The issue has taken on new urgency after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that part of the UKs overseas aid budget was being diverted to defence. In 202425, the UK is sending 282m in aid to Ukraine. The 2.5bn - and the interest accrued on the funds - would make up for some of money taken from the aid budget, which was 15.3bn in 2023. Alison Griffin, of charity Save the Children, said: This money has been sitting gathering dust - and interest - when it could and should have been spent helping the children of Ukraine cope with the horrors of a full-scale war that has lasted over three years. The delay in releasing the funds centres on a disagreement between the UK government and Abramovichs lawyers. Abramovich was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale. At the time, Abramovich said proceeds from the sale would be donated via a foundation for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine, and his position has not changed. Abramovich - a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas - cannot access the 2.5bn under UK sanctions but the money still legally belongs to him. He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied. Sources said Abramovichs lawyers have in...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vydlzv31do,2025-03-08
Reform UK refers MP Rupert Lowe to police,"Reform UK says it has suspended MP Rupert Lowe and referred him to police, alleging he made threats of physical violence against party chairman Zia Yusuf. In a statement with chief whip Lee Anderson, Yusuf also said the party had received allegations of bullying in Lowes parliamentary and constituency offices. The party has appointed a lawyer to conduct an investigation into allegations of workplace bullying made by two female employees, he added. Writing on social media platform X, Lowe said the partys allegations were untrue and false and he was disappointed, but not surprised to read them. He added there was zero credible evidence against him and he was seeking legal advice immediately. Lowe said his suspension was a reaction to having criticised party leader Nigel Farage in a newspaper interview. Reform, the successor to Farages Brexit Party, has been riding high in recent polls - but this is a spectacular and very public explosion of divisions at the top of the party. The party had only five MPs in the Commons, and Lowes suspension means it has now lost one. In an interview with the Daily Mail earlier this week, Lowe had said the party remained a protest party led by the Messiah under Farages leadership. Farage, he added, would need the right people around him to deliver the goods as party leader. Farage hit back in an interview, saying Lowe was completely wrong and Reform UK was absolutely not a protest party. A spokesman for Reform UK confirmed it had withdrawn the party whip from him, meaning he will not sit as part of the partys group in Parliament and becomes an independent MP. In response, Lowe said: I asked reasonable and constructive questions of Nigel Farage and Reforms leadership, following months of pushing for progress behind closed doors. The day after, I find a knife in my back over false allegations. Whip suspended. A Reform UK source denied the announcement of its investigation was connected to the public spat between Lowe and Farage. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: On Thursday 6 March we received an allegation of verbal threats made by a 67-year-old man on Friday 13 December 2024. Officers are carrying out an assessment of the allegations to determine what further action may be required. In its statement, the party said it had appointed a KC, a senior lawyer, to investigate the allegations of bullying in Lowes offices, adding it understood complaints had been made to parliamentary authorities. To date, Mr Lowe has yet to cooperate with this investigation, the statement added. In addition to these allegations of a disturbing pattern of behaviour, Mr Lowe has on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence against our party chairman. Accordingly, this matter is with the police. Writing on X after Reform UKs statement, Lowe said he had cooperated and spoken at length with the lawyer appointed by the party. In a further post on Saturday morning, Lowe asked Farage to have dinner with him to resolve th...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge5jl62nro,2025-03-08
Starmer welcomes EU moves to boost defence spending,"Sir Keir Starmer has welcomed an EU move to increase defence spending that was decided at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday. The package includes loans and weakened deficit rules in a bid to boost the continents military forces. Speaking after a call with EU leaders earlier, the prime minister said the historic move was another sign of Europe stepping up. It comes as Sir Keir tries to persuade European countries to join a coalition of the willing to deter Russia in the event of a peace deal in Ukraine. According to UK officials, about 20 countries are interested in joining the coalition, although would not necessarily offer to send troops, but instead provide other support. In recent weeks, EU leaders have repeated longstanding promises to boost Europes military capabilities, after voicing concerns the continent cannot rely on US security support under President Trump. At a summit in Brussels on Thursday, they backed plans to jointly borrow 150bn to lend to EU governments for military expenditure. The European Commission has also proposed diverting regional development funds towards defence, alongside an emergency suspension of the blocs rules on government debt and deficit levels. Starmer was briefed on the plans in a call earlier with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, alongside the leaders of Canada, Turkey, Norway and Iceland. Afterwards Downing Street said the prime minister applauded the progress made at the Brussels meeting. He also discussed plans for the coalition of the willing and noted a meeting in Paris next week would be an important moment to drive forward planning, a No 10 spokeswoman added. The UK and France have said they are willing to provide peacekeeping troops to Ukraine and are urging other European countries to make the same commitment. But Sir Keir has said that in order to be effective, their presence in Ukraine must be backed by security guarantees from the US. US President Donald Trump has so far avoided committing to such support, instead arguing that the presence of American workers in Ukraine as part of a potential minerals deal, would be sufficient to deter Russia from further invading Ukraine. Russia has flatly rejected such a move saying it would amount to direct, official and unveiled involvement of Nato members in the war against Russia. Talks between the US and Ukraine aimed at reaching an agreement will take place next week in Saudi Arabia. Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Friday he was strongly considering new sanctions and tariffs on Russia, following a wave of overnight strikes on Ukraine. Writing on social media, he added: To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!! UK Defence Secretary John Healey earlier returned from Washington DC, where he met with his US counterpart Pete Hegseth to discuss ending Russias war on Ukraine. Speaking in Washington, Healey said: Its a lasting, secure peace th...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wpy9x890wo,2025-03-08
Former Liverpool mayor charged with bribery,"Former Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson and city politician Derek Hatton have been charged with bribery and misconduct relating to council contracts, along with 10 others, police have said. The charges come after a Merseyside Police probe, Operation Aloft, focused on a number of property developers. Mr Anderson and Mr Hatton were first arrested in 2020 as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts. Posting on X, the former mayor urged people against falling into the trap of saying no smoke without fire. He added: I am innocent of charges and will fight to clear my name. Thank you for all the messages of support and best wishes. Father-of-four Mr Anderson was elected in 2012, having been a Labour councillor since 1998. Merseyside Police said 12 individuals had been charged following an investigation connected to the awarding of commercial and business contracts from Liverpool City Council between 2010 and 2020. Liverpool City Council said it had supported the police investigation and would continue to cooperate as required. A spokesperson added: It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage. Those charged are: They will all appear at Preston Magistrates Court on 28 March. Robin Weyell, deputy chief crown prosecutor said: The Crown Prosecution Service has reviewed a full file of evidence from Merseyside Police and has authorised the investigation team to charge 12 people with 12 offences related to bribery and misconduct in public office. He said criminal proceedings were now active and it was extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.

Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down,"A bill that had suggested banning smartphones in schools and addictive algorithms aimed at young teenagers has been watered down to gain government support. Labour MP Josh MacAlister, who brought the private members bill, told MPs during a parliamentary debate on Friday that reducing smartphone use in law would be a process, not one big bang event. The proposed legislation calls for the government to say within a year whether it will raise the digital age of consent from 13 to 16 - meaning companies could not receive childrens data without parental permission until that age. Data Protection and Telecoms Minister Chris Bryant said the bills recommendations very much chime with what we intend to do. The bill also says parents need further guidance on smartphone use by children and urges the government to come up with a plan for research into the impact of use of social media on children within 12 months. Bryant said his department had asked the University of Cambridge to run a feasibility study into the impact of smartphones and social media - and that it would work to roughly the same timetable as the bill was calling for. He added that measures from the Online Safety Act due to be implemented in the coming months, would help protect children online. The act puts a duty on social media companies to protect children from harmful content. Bryant concluded his speech by telling MPs inaction is not an option for the government, adding that it was not the end of the matter. The debate on the bill was adjourned until 11 July. Private members bills rarely make it into law without government backing, but they are an opportunity for backbenchers to raise an issues profile. When the legislation was initially proposed in October, it outlined plans to give head teachers legal backing to make schools mobile free, and strengthen Ofcoms powers to prevent children being exposed to apps and services addictive by design. In Fridays debate, Conservative Kit Malthouse, a former education secretary, told the House of Commons the watering down amounted to the gutting of what could have been a landmark bill. He said parents were screaming for help from lawmakers, and that this government, like the last, has dithered, diluted and capitulated on the issue. When asked about the changes, MacAlister, a former teacher, said he had been working really closely with the government to put forward practical measures, and was optimistic ministers would support it. Responding to criticism of the bills watering down in Parliament, MacAlister said it was important that MPs made progress on the issue at every possible opportunity. There have been growing calls to restrict childrens smartphone use, including local schools combining to revise their phone policies and parent groups joining forces to delay giving their child a smartphone. However, some of those in favour of smartphones say they provide opportunities for child development, including socialising, and there is little evidence...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8y7dvw9ddo,2025-03-08
Minister threatens law change after 'two-tier' row,"Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has told the Sentencing Council she will review its powers and legislate, if necessary, following a row over its new guidance on sending people to jail. The changes, which are due to come into force in England and Wales next month, would make the ethnicity or faith of an offender a bigger factor when deciding whether to jail them. Ministers do not have the power to overturn the guidance, but in a letter Mahmood urged the councils chairman to reconsider as soon as possible. Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the new rules were anti-white and anti-Christian and amounted to two-tier justice. In a post on social media, he said that if the government did not act he would challenge the rules in court. The Sentencing Council said the guidance would ensure courts had the most comprehensive information available to hand out an appropriate sentence and could address disadvantages faced within the criminal justice system. Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences. The analysis produced by the Ministry of Justice said the difference could be attributed to a range of factors including the varying offence mix across ethnic groups. It added that lower average custodial sentences for white defendants may be a result of a higher percentage of guilty plea rates for this ethnic group, resulting in shorter custodial sentences. Writing to Lord Justice William Davis, chairman of the Sentencing Council, Mahmood said she wanted to make clear my displeasure at the changes. As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law, she wrote. She said she would be considering whether policy decisions of such import should be made by the Sentencing Council. A review of the councils role and powers will now take place alongside the existing review into sentencing being led by former Tory minister David Gauke. Mahmood concluded her letter by warning the council that following the review she would legislate if necessary. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - who previously sat on the Sentencing Council when he was director of public prosecutions - said he was concerned by the guidance. The new sentencing guidance puts a greater emphasis on the need for pre-sentence reports for judges. Pre-sentence reports give judges details on the offenders background, motives and personal life before sentencing - then recommend a punishment and what would work best for rehabilitation. But over recent years their use has decreased. Magistrates and judges will be advised to get a pre-sentence report before handing out punishment for someone of an ethnic or faith minority - alongside other groups such as young adults, abuse survivors and pregnant women. These factors are not an exhaustive list, the council said. A pre-sentence report can still be necessary if an individual does not f...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984l6pn30zo,2025-03-08
Ex-Tory minister claims Drakeford dented Covid trust,"Mark Drakeford dented peoples confidence in the UK government during the pandemic, the Welsh secretary at the time has said. Simon Hart said it was exactly what you dont want in a national crisis, telling the BBC Walescast podcast of his frustration with the then Labour first minister. Drakeford was selecting all the things that worked and claiming them as Welsh government, and then being very public about the things that didnt work, and saying that they were UK government, said the ex-Conservative MP. The Welsh government said: All decisions by Welsh ministers related to Covid-19 were based on evidence and always made in the best interests of Wales. The former Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP has published diaries on his time in the UK cabinet, first as secretary of state for Wales under Boris Johnson and then as Rishi Sunaks chief whip, enforcing party discipline. In Ungovernable: The Political Diaries of a Chief Whip Hart makes clear his frustration at the relationship between the two governments, particularly during the Covid -19 pandemic. He also comments on Mr Drakefords appearance at a Remembrance Day event, calling him a scruffy old university lecturer with dirty shoes. Hart told Walescast Drakeford was a very nice man, but hed never made any secret of the fact he was no massive fan of devolution. He said he felt Drakeford helped to create a false impression that nice Mr Drakeford - and he is a very nice man - had all the solutions, and nasty Mr Johnson caused all of the problems. I thought that was a very lazy politicisation of a very serious situation and I thought Mark Drakeford was party to that, said Hart. It wasnt necessarily about political advantage. The consequence, said Hart, was messaging to the public that was not as clear as it might have been to minimise the risk of the pandemic causing even more mayhem. Hart said he wrote the book to ask the question what went wrong? between December 2019 and July 2024, when the Conservatives went from an 80-seat majority to a general election drubbing. In a separate interview with BBC Politics Wales, to be broadcast on Sunday, he said we have to ask ourselves the question, how on earth did this happen? That is a spectacular fall from grace and, unless were prepared to look in the mirror and say ok lets be serious about what we did well and what we did badly, we will continue to make those mistakes. I dont think it makes particularly comfortable reading at times, he told Walescast. Things went from comedy to tragedy very quickly, as I went from being patient and well-meaning to irritable and disillusioned at times, if I was honest, he added. He stopped short of saying the Conservative Party was ungovernable, characterising his account as more of a description of politics more generally. Keir Starmer suddenly found he was hitting exactly the same headwinds as wed hit fairly early on in his tenure, said Hart. Big majority, new government, all of that - yet it was still difficult.

Tory peer apologises for Holocaust memorial comment,"Conservative peer Lord Hamilton has apologised after saying the Jewish community should pay for their own Holocaust memorial because they have an awful lot of money. The former minister said his comments in a House of Lords debate on plans for a memorial near Parliament were insensitive but not intended to be antisemitic. A Conservative Party spokesman condemned the comments as completely unacceptable and flagrantly antisemitic. Responding to calls for him to be suspended from the parliamentary party, leader Kemi Badenoch said: I have intervened in the situation. Lord Hamilton misspoke and hes apologised and I think that should be the end of the matter. Speaking during a debate on legislation to allow a Holocaust memorial and learning centre to be built in Westminster, with public funds used to pay for it, Lord Hamilton said: I do not understand why the government have volunteered taxpayers money, when there is so little of it, to finance this. The Jewish community in Britain has an awful lot of money. It has a lot of education charities that would contribute towards this. I do not understand why they should not pay for their own memorial. Challenged by Lord Austin that the memorial was for everybody not just the Jewish community, Lord Hamilton added: I take that point, but the driving forces behind putting up this memorial are the Jewish people in this country. They are people who have property everywhere. I do not see why they should not fund it. The former minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major withdrew his comments the following day and said in a statement: My remarks were not intended to be antisemitic and I apologise unreservedly. With retrospect having read my comments, I realise that my remarks were insensitive and I apologise. I intend to meet with groups from the Jewish community in order to better understand how to communicate about issues affecting British Jews. His original remarks were criticised by the Antisemitism Policy Trust, who said they were ill-judged, racist and false. During the debate, Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein said: The Holocaust is not something that is just about the Jews. He added that Lord Hamiltons comments were probably a pretty eloquent contribution as to why we need this memorial - and near Parliament. Former Labour MP and crossbench peer Lord Austin described the remarks as disgusting racism and called on the Conservative Party to take proper action. The Tories were quick to demand Labour took action on antisemitism and quite right too, he wrote on social media. But they must now do the same themselves. Plans for a Holocaust memorial in Victoria Tower Gardens in Westminster were first announced under Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron in 2016. A bill to remove restrictions on the memorial being built in the gardens and to allow public funds to be used for it is currently making its way through Parliament.

Labour MPs urge investors to support defence firms,"More than 100 Labour MPs and peers have urged banks and investment firms to relax their rules on investing in defence companies. In an open letter, first reported by the Financial Times, they said ill considered ethical investment rules had been holding back their access to finance. They wrote that a change in approach would help the UK bolster its defences, and contribute to the governments drive to boost economic growth. It also reflects a trend in recent years to emphasise the national security element of defence investment since Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Leading weapons companies have seen sales and their share price surge in recent years, as countries seek to rearm after years of declining defence spending. The UK is among those countries committing to ramp up spending, with Sir Keir Starmer announcing plans last week to increase defence spending from 2.3 to 2.5 of national income by 2027, funded by cuts to overseas aid. However in their letter, the politicians argued that environmental, social and governance (ESG) rules adopted by some banks and fund managers are continuing to impact the sectors access to finance. They said ESG rules, which can prevent investment in oil, tobacco and other sectors deemed unethical, had generally driven positive change in the economy. But they added that financial institutions should rethink ESG mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment. The letter was co-ordinated by the Labour Growth Group, a group of MPs formed last year in part to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects. Some investment funds have adopted specific rules against investing in weapons manufacturers and others have broader rules obliging them to consider the risk that investment could lead to human rights breaches. But some analysts have pointed out that attitudes on the ethics of investing in the sector appear to have shifted in recent years, with the share of ESG funds holding shares in defence and aerospace firms on the up compared to 2022. The previous Conservative government had also sought to encourage defence investment, with former prime minister Rishi Sunak arguing there is nothing more ethical than defending our way of life. The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, signed a statement last year stating that investment in good, high-quality, well-run defence companies was compatible with ESG considerations. In their letter, the MPs and peers also argued that defence firms faced unnecessary barriers to doing business in the UK, echoing longstanding complaints from the sector about access to finance. ADS, the industry lobby group, has previously argued that defence firms face higher regulatory barriers when it comes to securing bank accounts and loans. These include rules obliging banks to run enhanced money laundering checks for defence and security companies, and to make sure they are not financing weapons banned under international treaties.

Police unit dubbed 'authoritarian censor',"A national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the publics right to know. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found. Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team  known as the central referral unit (CRU)  was acting like an authoritarian censor rather than a public body. The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The BBC was alerted to the units involvement in local forces FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids. Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UKs total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the units request. The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers. Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time. On another occasion, it cited concerns about negative press when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates. The software has been banned by Scotland Yard. Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body. It is alarming that the NPCC is going beyond giving advice to individual forces and instead seemingly orchestrating how every force responds to sensitive transparency requests, he said. The CRU said it was legitimately discussing negative press or media attention when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure. It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020. FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure. Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret. The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies. Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called applicant-blind principle when responding to FOI requests. The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the a...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0ypn4pyyro,2025-03-08
Bid to slice Melton Mowbray pork pie zone refused,"An application to shrink the geographical area where Melton Mowbray pork pies can be produced has been rejected. The pies have special protected geographical status, which means only producers using the traditional recipe and in the vicinity of the Melton Mowbray can use the Leicestershire towns name. The pastry can be produced in the town of Melton Mowbray and its surrounding region, including Nottingham to the north and Northampton to the south, but The Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (MMPPA) applied for this area to be reduced. However, the request was refused by the Department for Environment, Food  Rural Affairs (Defra) in decision notice published on Wednesday. The pies status is called Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). Matthew OCallaghan, chairman of the MMPPA, said when the group originally applied for the protection - awarded in 2008 - they had historical evidence as to where the boundaries should go. He said: In the south, the boundary was originally the road between Leicester and Stamford. But Defra suggested it be extended because a company in Wellingborough, which had been making the pork pies for decades, objected as it would have been outside the area, Mr OCallaghan said. Mr OCallaghan added: We agreed the area would be almost doubled so as to go down to the south to include this producer in Wellingborough. However, he said the producer - Saxbys - had closed and no pork pies had been made in that area for at least 10 years. Mr OCallaghan said the association therefore thought it was reasonable to ask Defra to amend the region to the original proposal. It would not have affected anybody currently producing Melton Mowbray pork pies, he added. He said the association was disappointed the application was rejected because we think what people want when they buy a Melton Mowbray pork pie is a pie tied to a historic area. Explaining the area they wanted the protection reduced to, he said it was between the Leicester to Stamford road - the A47 to the south, the Great North Road the A1 to the east, the River Trent in the north, including Nottingham, and then to the west, the River Soar. Defras notice rejecting the application said: The proposed amendment would reduce the geographical production area and exclude certain producers from using the PGI designation. This would directly affect market access and impose new trade restrictions, which is not permitted under the regulation. It added: The applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the quality, reputation, or characteristics of the product are now exclusive to the proposed smaller area. The association has been advised if it opts to appeal against the decision, the deadline is 2 April. Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The MP who was shot in the foot as a teen,"It was two days before his 18th birthday in 1994 when Stuart Anderson was shot. He was taking part in a live fire training exercise on the Brecon Beacons when he heard a gun fire close by. His friend screamed and Stuart thought somebody else had been injured. Rifleman Anderson rushed to give his comrade first aid but quickly realised that he could not move his left leg, which now felt warm. That was the moment when he realised that he had been shot in the foot. This report contains images of severe injury There was no way of getting me down from the mountains and I was left there for hours without pain relief, he said. They got me to hospital in Abergavenny and a surgeon told me that Id probably have to have my foot amputated. I did what every hardened rifleman did, which was cry and ask for my mum, he said with a smile. A specialist surgeon managed to save his foot and all five toes over four separate operations, but the injury was too complex to ever fully recover from. His gunshot wound was caused by a fault in the assault rifle, which the British Army used at the time. Another soldiers SA80 had overheated in training and fired by mistake, an error which is known as cooking off. Despite having to learn to walk again, the 48-year-old, went on to serve in various campaigns, including Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo. He retired from the Royal Green Jackets, now known as The Rifles, eight years after joining the army and went into the security and defence industry. Then in 2019 he was elected the Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West, and last year he became the new MP for South Shropshire. But the pain in his foot would not go away. I was told after my surgery that I would never walk without a walking stick but I was determined to live a full and active life. Ten years after I left the military I had to pay to have shrapnel taken out of my foot. Ive pushed myself to the extreme in multiple sports, but it away hurts. He said he received no support from the Army after he left, despite having 10 operations over the last 31 years. In January, he had his most recent surgery through the NHS to reconstruct his foot, but weeks later he had to have a follow up operation to remove two toes. I probably should have had the surgery 18 months ago but I was a whip in government during historic times and I didnt have the capacity to step back from that, he said. If the latest procedure has not been a success then he may have to have another operation to have more of his foot removed. The MP is using his experience to highlight the suffering and lengthy recovery that many veterans face when leaving the armed forces with injuries. Im a member of Parliament facing this, so I can use my position for good and raise awareness of some of the dreadful things that Shropshire veterans have been through, he said. Improvements have happened over the years but we are nowhere near where we need to go.

HMP Highpoint set to become 'UK's largest jail',"A rural prison is to increase its capacity by more than 50 to become the UKs largest jail, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said. Three four-storey houseblocks will be built at HMP Highpoint in Suffolk, between the villages of Stradishall and Great Thurlow, near Haverhill. Construction work has begun on the 700-place expansion, including workshops and teaching facilities to help prisoners get jobs on release, said the MoJ. Minister for Prisons, Lord Timpson, said they were designed with a laser-focus on cutting crime and were part of plans to deliver 14,000 more prison spaces by 2031. We cannot simply build our way out of this crisis, which is why were also reviewing sentencing so we can lock up dangerous offenders, cut crime and make our streets safer, Lord Timpson added. Highpoint currently holds just under 1,300 prisoners. The MoJ said that on completion, Highpoint will be the largest prison in terms of land size in North-West Europe and the largest in the UK based on prisoner population. Prison governor Nigel Smith said: The new accommodation will provide a safe and secure environment for us to rehabilitate prisoners and get them ready for release. The expansion is part of the governments 2.3bn 10-year prison capacity strategy. The government released certain offenders early last year to ease overcrowding in prisons. In January 2024, HM Inspectorate of Prisons said Highpoint was failing to deliver its core purpose to prepare men for their return to the community. Since August 2022, it has worked with City and Guilds, which offers vocational education and apprenticeship partnerships, to teach inmates how to maintain railway infrastructure. Building and property maintenance company Wates Group has been contracted to deliver the new accommodation and workshop blocks. The MoJ said it would create hundreds of jobs during its construction and more than 200 jobs once it is built.

UK and Ireland have 'turned a page on the turbulent years',"The UK and Ireland have turned a page on the turbulent years in their relationship and are set on a meaningful partnership, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said. He was speaking alongside the Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin as part of a UK-Ireland summit in Liverpool. Sir Keir said the event marked a new era between the two governments, which was the right thing to do...given the global situation. While the taoiseach said he appreciated the prime ministers proactivity in resetting relations with the Irish government, after years of difficulties with the Conservatives during Brexit negotiations. The summit is the first of its kind and comes amid the backdrop of growing security concerns among the UK and EU countries about the influence of Russia. The business roundtable on Thursday morning included industry leaders and businesses across tech, finance, clean energy, manufacturing and construction from the UK and Ireland. The discussion focused on potential opportunities for growth and investment, and how the UK and Ireland can work together to build an even more resilient and successful trading relationship. They also discussed how both countries can work closer together on renewable energy, tech, AI and security. The two leaders have announced a new data sharing arrangement aimed at increasing the production offshore energy. As part of the summit, Ireland also announced new investments into the UK worth 185.5 million, which the UK government say could create more than 2,500 jobs across the country. On Wednesday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the UK-Ireland summit marked a major and significant manifestation of a reset in relations between the two governments in the post-Brexit era. He also paid tribute to the prime minister for his leadership over the last while. He has been effective and impactful, we all want peace - there are too many wars in the world, he told reporters.",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9817w0k61jo,2025-03-08
Water fluoridation expansion plans confirmed,"About 1.6 million more people will have their water supply fluoridated, the government has confirmed. The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it would introduce fluoridation to more areas of north-east England. The plans had been out for public consultation last year. The DHSC said it hoped the move would cut the number of children admitted to hospital for tooth decay operations. The British Dental Association (BDA) said it welcomed the move. Dr Lucy OMalley at the University of Manchester said the scheme would likely benefit children but there was no evidence water fluoridation reduced oral health inequalities. This meant other measures needed to be put in place as well, she said. Alongside its plans to increase water fluoridation in the North East, DHSC also announced a major nationwide supervised toothbrushing scheme. Prof Anne-Marie Glenny, also from the University of Manchester, said the widespread availability of fluoride toothpaste made the impact of fluoridating water less significant. While this effect is less than in the past and may not be felt on an individual level, this still may represent an important population level effect, she said. She said fluoridating water supplies should be considered against costs and potential harms, and fluoride levels should be actively monitored. Northumbrian Water has been supplying artificially fluoridated water since the late 1960s to Chester-le-Street, Consett, and Stanley in County Durham, Alnwick, Hexham and Cramlington in Northumberland and parts of North Tyneside, Newcastle and Gateshead. DHSC will now expand the scheme to Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, South Tyneside, Stockton, Sunderland and areas not currently covered in Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside. The body said about one in 10 people in England currently had fluoride added to their water supplies. It did not say when this new North East expansion would occur. The government previously said for every 1 spent on water fluoridation in the area, it expected to save 13 after five years. The BDA said the scheme would provide a very strong return on investment and the government needed to double down to safeguard dental health. This included mandatory action on the marketing, labelling and reformulation of sugary food and drink, it said.

NZ fires envoy to UK who questioned Trump's grasp of history,"New Zealand has fired its most senior envoy to the United Kingdom over remarks that questioned US President Donald Trumps grasp of history. At an event in London on Tuesday, High Commissioner Phil Goff compared efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine to the 1938 Munich Agreement, which allowed Adolf Hitler to annex part of Czechoslovakia. Mr Goff recalled how Sir Winston Churchill had criticised the agreement, then said of the US leader: President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history? His comments were deeply disappointing and made his position untenable, New Zealands Foreign Minister Winston Peters said. His comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. He contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germanys threats. Mr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war. Peters said Mr Goffs views did not represent those of the New Zealand government. When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, youre not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand, local media reported Peters saying. Its not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically, he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about. Mr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealands largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence. Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon. When it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: I know hes the prime minister, I made him the prime minister. The 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxons National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government. Luxon, for his part, said Peters decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was entirely appropriate. Former Prime Minister Helen Clark was among those who criticised Mr Goffs sacking, saying it was backed by a very thin excuse. I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 and US actions now, she wrote in a post on X.

"US 'destroying' world order, Ukraine's ambassador to UK says","The US is destroying the established world order, Ukraines ambassador to the UK has claimed. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said the White House had questioned the unity of the Western world and was taking more and more steps towards Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The comments come as the US puts pressure on Ukraine to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, and after a public clash between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump. Zelensky has since said he is ready to work under Trumps strong leadership, an apparent cooling in tensions welcomed by Trump - and which comes after the US paused military aid to Kyiv. But Mr Zaluzhnyis remarks at a conference at Chatham House in London on Thursday suggest there remains discontent over the USs actions. He told an audience: We see that it is not only Russia and the axis of evil trying to destroy the world order, but the US is actually destroying it completely. The Ukrainian envoy added that talks between the US and Russia - the latter of which was headed by a war criminal in President Vladimir Putin - showed the White House was making steps towards the Kremlin regime, fully realising that in this case Europe could be a new target for Russia. Mr Zaluzhnyi, who took over as Kyivs ambassador to London in 2024 following three years as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, also suggested that Nato could cease to exist as a result of Washingtons change in posture. While Zelensky has expressed a wish to bring the war in Ukraine to an end swiftly, Kyiv has voiced concerns about the Trump administrations handling of talks and the concessions to Moscow that may be made without firm security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump vowed during the US election campaign to bring the war to an end quickly, and preliminary US-Russian talks were held in Saudi Arabia last month - without European or Ukrainian representatives present. The USs decision to halt its military assistance to Ukraine and intelligence sharing has been cast by Trump administration officials as a means of getting Kyiv to co-operate with the US-led peace talks. Any corresponding pressure the US has been putting on Moscow to make concessions has not been made public. Zaluzhnyi said the pause in intelligence sharing, as well as an earlier decision to oppose a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, were a huge challenge for the entire world. His comments come as Politico reports that members of Trumps team held discussions with some of Zelenskys political opponents, after Trump allies suggested the Ukrainian president should stand aside as his term expired in May. Citing unnamed sources in the US and Ukraine, it says talks were held with opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and senior members of Petro Poroshenkos party, who preceded Zelensky as president. Independent opinion polls in Ukraine suggest Zaluzhnyi has the most public support with at least 70, Zelensky has 57 suppor...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq9n48el43o,2025-03-08
"Emergency powers being abused to dig up roads, MPs told","Utilities companies are abusing their emergency powers to dig up streets in England, causing major disruption for drivers and public transport, MPs have been told. Emergency powers allow works to be carried out with little or no notice in certain circumstances such as gas leaks or a burst water pipe. Giving evidence to Transport Committee, Keith McNally, from the Confederation of Passenger Transport which represents bus operators, said his members felt these powers were sometimes being used for non-emergencies. However, Clive Bairsto from Streetworks UK, the trade association for utilities companies, said there was no evidence of abuse of powers. MPs on the Transport Committee are conducting an inquiry into street works - the work carried out by utilities companies to install, repair or maintain services such as broadband or water. Jack Cousens, head of roads policy at the AA, told MPs that the average number of holes being dug by utility firms in England outside of London had jumped from 13,250 per local authority in 2018 to more than 17,200 last year. He said improving broadband and rolling out charge points for electric vehicles were contributing factors but added there is also more evidence of just general works going on from utilities companies. McNally said a surge in roadworks was making route planning and timetabling increasingly difficult - pointing out that during the day some bus services have to repeatedly loop past the same excavations causing further and further delays. He added that unlike other road users, buses can not simply divert down routes of their drivers choosing because passengers need to be collected at specific points. Asked whether the emergency permit to open up roads was being abused, McNally said he believed it was. The number of works undertaken on an emergency basis seems to have increased. Im not sure about the overall volume but our members are saying to us that a very high proportion seem to be on an emergency basis. Cousens questioned why more works by different companies could not be done at the same time to prevent repeat disruption to roads. The gas company seems to be in one week, they go away, then the water company get in the hole, then they disappear. Then the broadband company get in the hole and they fill it back up and they disappear and somebody else comes in. And we have this horrible cycle of roadworks that never seem to end that then create lots of other problems with the road surface with potholes ruining the structural integrity of our roads. The Transport Committee was told there are over 200 different organisations which have rights to open up the road surface. Bairsto said it was normal practice to try and co-ordinate works - with some local authorities even having champions to do just that. In a debate at the beginning of the year, Transport Minister Lillian Greenwood said her department had examined Street Manager data and spoken to industry representatives and found no evidence of misuse.",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr29xn4rlpo,2025-03-08
Reform would scrap 'net stupid zero' policies - Tice,"The deputy leader of Reform UK has said his party would scrap net stupid zero policies during a visit to Scotland. Richard Tice said eco-policies such as targets to achieve net zero were destroying jobs in the oil and gas sector. The politician is in Scotland to announce a further two councillors have defected to join his party. He said Reform UK was growing in popularity because their policies will make people better off. Speaking on the BBC Radios Good Morning Scotland programme, Tice said the party was picking up support due to its common sense approach. He said: The reason we are going up in the polls is because our policies are the policies that will make people better off. For example scrapping net stupid zero that is destroying tens and tens of thousands of great, highly skilled, well-paid Scottish jobs in the oil and gas industry, in the chemicals industry. He added: We are the new kids on the block, weve got some bold policies that can turn around the Scottish economy. He said Scotland would benefit most of all from scrapping green targets, which he claimed were so destructive to jobs and skills. The deputy leader previously argued net-zero policies were to blame for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK. In February, he announced that Reform UK plans to tax solar farms, and pass new laws to put energy cables underground rather than on pylons. Despite scrapping certain climate change targets last year, the Scottish government still aims to achieve net zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by 2045. This is five years ahead of the UKs target of 2050. Tice was speaking during a visit to Scotland to announce two more councillors have defected to his party from the Scottish Conservative party. They are John Gray from Renfrewshire Council and Ross Lambie from South Lanarkshire Council. He said he was very proud of the councillors who are joining the party from the now frankly irrelevant Conservative party. But when pushed to name his partys new members and which councils they served on, Mr Tice repeated their first names John and Ross. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said the party is focussed on reaching out to voters who are disillusioned with all parties and all politicians. Five former Scottish Conservative councillors have already defected to Reform - one in Glasgow, two in Aberdeenshire and two in North Ayrshire. Tice, the MP for Boston and Skegness, said: Were going up in the polls, I think youre going to see us by the summer around 20. He also claimed that Reform almost have more members in Scotland than the Labour Party. In 2021, Labour had about 16,000 members in Scotland. Reform says their current membership in Scotland is about 9,300. Tice said: I think thats the reason why John Swinney and the Labour Party, Anas Sarwar, are terrified. Tice added they intend to field candidates in every seat during next years Scottish parliament elections, campaigning with Scotland specific policies, in an attempt to secure th...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k75qp1edo,2025-03-08
"Councils fear shake-up won't improve finances, survey says","A large portion of council leaders fear a major shake-up of local government will not solve the financial pressures their authorities are facing, a survey has suggested. Ministers are streamlining local government by merging councils and setting up single authorities that provide all the services in their areas. But a survey by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU) think tank suggested there was low support for it among council leaders, with less than a quarter of those who responded believing the changes would ease their financial challenges. A government spokesperson said reorganisation was a tough choice but the right one to improve the sustainability and resilience of local authorities. Councils have been under financial pressure for some time. A recent report by the National Audit Office found funding had failed to keep pace with growing demand for services - particularly social care, support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, and temporary accommodation. The government has increased the amount of money available to councils, and has promised to reform the way their funding works. The government says the reorganisation will streamline and simplify services, make savings and create structures that will allow more powers to be handed down to council leaders and mayors. But in some areas the plans have proved controversial. A survey of council leaders and senior officials, carried out by the LGIU, found many thought the plans were unclear, the timescales were not achievable and while the plans might produce long-term savings, they would add to pressure on councils in the short-term. Only 23 of those surveyed agreed with the statement that the reorganisation would alleviate the financial challenges facing councils. The survey received responses from 150 councils out of 317 in England. The think tanks chief executive, Jonathan Carr-West, said: On the one hand, the government has had some success in resetting the central-local relationship and there is near consensus that the promised multi-year settlements will benefit council finances. Conversely, many councils are anticipating that reorganisation and the increase in National Insurance Contributions will heap added pressure onto already overextended council budgets. The LGIU said the problems were not insurmountable, calling for councils to be more involved and more manageable timescales. The restructuring of local councils started in some places under the last Conservative government, with Labour planning to extend it across all of England. It would mean areas with two-tiers of councils, both county and district, would be replaced with single unitary councils that provide all services, with more regional mayors. Last month the government agreed to delay local elections that were due to take place in May in nine council areas to allow them to reorganise. For some, its a welcome move that will make help councils deliver services more effectively. Tim Oliver, chai...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3yl3ppe95o,2025-03-08
Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed,"Ministers, facing potential cuts of billions of pounds from the welfare budget, have announced plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work. The coaches are already employed by job centres but will be redeployed to focus on tackling economic inactivity, said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). It said the staff would provide personalised and intensive support to thousands of sick and disabled people. But the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on people on low incomes, said only a tiny percentage would actually find a job. The coaches will offer tailored employment support to people on health-related benefits and help them access support with writing CVs and interview techniques, the government said. Ministers hope moving thousands of people into jobs will help them unlock the benefits of work and cut the rapidly rising cost of health and disability benefits. But the Resolution Foundation said only about 3 of the hundreds of thousands of people likely to lose benefit payments were likely to find a job. In a report called Delivering the Undeliverable, the researchers argue the causes of the rising welfare costs include the country getting older and sicker and that while ministers are keen on quick financial cuts, truly effective reforms will take time to deliver. The government described the 1,000 redeployed work coaches as a downpayment on plans to overhaul employment support, set to be unveiled within weeks. The current system fails to intervene early enough to stop people becoming unemployed and misses opportunities to support their return, the DWP said. It has become defined by poor experiences and low trust among many people who use it, it added. Some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness, the department said. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase on the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the broken welfare system Labour had inherited was failing sick and disabled people, is bad for the taxpayer, and holding the economy back. For too long, sick, and disabled people have been told they cant work, denied support, and locked out of jobs, with all the benefits that good work brings, she said. But many sick and disabled people want and can work, with the right support. Selected figures published from a survey for the government suggest 44 of disabled people and those with a health condition in the UK do not trust the DWP to help people reach their full career potential. The same proportion believe DWP does not provide enough support to those out of work because of disability, ill health or a long-term health condition, according to the survey.

Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions,"The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the governments official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellors financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said the world has changed since Rachel Reevess Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had 9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. The OBRs forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK. The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its major measures -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellors self-imposed rules on borrowing money. The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending. Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are non-negotiable. The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March. The Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes, a government insider told the BBC. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellors response later this month. Insiders expect politically painful new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4s Today programme there had been a huge rise in the welfare budget and there were too many young people not in work, education or training. Theres a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and theres a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable, she added. Reeves has previously pledged fundamental reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election.

Ex-ambassadors warn of sharing intelligence with US,"Four former British ambassadors to the United States have expressed concern about the future of intelligence sharing with the US following the re-election of Donald Trump. Sir David Manning, who served as ambassador between 2003 and 2007, told a parliamentary committee some of Trumps appointees had strange track records which would create a problem on the intelligence front. Dame Karen Pierce, who only left the role last month, said intelligence sharing would continue even if at the top level there might be things we might wish to be circumspect about. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, ambassador from 2007 to 2012, said the relationship would be trickier to handle than probably at any other time. He said some of the people appointed by Trump to lead intelligence and security could present some difficulties in terms of their view of us and views of co-operation. He did not specify who he was referring to, however concern has been raised about the US presidents pick to be his director of national intelligence. Tulsi Gabbard has previously echoed Russias justification for invading Ukraine and her appointment to the role was welcomed by Russian state media. Earlier this year Lewis Lukens, a retired American diplomat, told the BBC that Gabbards dubious judgement could give allies reason to question how safe it is to share intelligence with the US. During her confirmation hearing with US senators, Gabbard dismissed suggestions she was Putins puppet as lies and smears. The ambassadors warnings came during an evidence session with the House of Lords International Relations and Defence Committee which heard from four former British diplomats to the US. Sir David told peers that if the UK wanted to be the go-to ally for the United States it had to have something to offer. He said the UKs military resources were stretched and the defence card was not the ace it once was. Lord Soames said the UK was still very, very, very good at intelligence and security and asked if that would still play a role in the UK-US relationship. Sir David said the question of intelligence-sharing was going to be more difficult to approach. Clearly if you have some Trump supportees in these key jobs who have very strange track records and have said very strange things about Nato allies and the Nato alliance and you have people in the administration who seem to be looking for ways of appeasing Russia then you have a problem on the intelligence front. That is a big question mark against how the special relationship is sustained during the Trump administration. Dame Karen said the way the US and UK helped each other was unique adding: There is an interoperability that you dont find with any other ally. Asked if that would last under the Trump presidency, she replied: The intelligence part of the relationship is so valuable it will last  even if as David was explaining - at the top level there might be things we might wish to be a bit circumspect about.

PM pays tribute to British troops after Vance comments,"Sir Keir Starmer has paid tribute to British veterans who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, after US Vice-President JD Vance was accused of disrespecting UK troops. Without directly referring to Vances comments, Sir Keir opened Prime Ministers Questions by remembering those who died fighting for Britain alongside our allies. On Tuesday, Vance was criticised for saying a US stake in Ukraines economy was a better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasnt fought a war in 30 or 40 years. The UK and France have said they would be willing to put troops in Ukraine as part of a peace deal - although Vance later insisted he did not mention either country. The prime minister told the Commons: Tomorrow marks 13 years since six young British soldiers were on patrol in Afghanistan when their vehicle was struck by an explosive tragically killing them all. He added: These men fought and died for their country, our country. And across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 642 individuals died fighting for Britain alongside our allies, many more were wounded. We will never forget their bravery and their sacrifice, and I know the whole House will join me in remembering them and all those who serve our country. Challenged over whether the tribute was a direct response to Vances comments, the prime ministers official spokesman said: You can draw your own conclusions. It is not standard practice for the PM to mark the anniversaries of the deaths of soldiers. Vances comments were later raised by Liberal Democrat MP Richard Foord, who suggested the vice-president should have more respect for those who lost their lives. He asked Sir Keir whether he would remind the US government the UK supported the country in Iraq following the 911 attacks. In response, the PM said: He speaks for the whole House. We do remember the role we played historically with our allies and we particularly remember those that made the ultimate sacrifice in that duty for their country and for our allies and thats why its so important that we make that point today. Although Vance did not specify which country or countries he was referring to in his interview with Fox Newss Hannity programme, he later stressed that he did not mention the UK or France. In a social media post, he said: But lets be direct: there are many countries who are volunteering (privately or publicly) support who have neither the battlefield experience nor the military equipment to do anything meaningful. So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, although Sir Keir has previously said a number of countries have agreed to. Vances original comments drew criticism from opposition MPs in the UK, as well as the French armed forces minister.

UK government to end North Sea windfall tax in 2030,"The UK government has launched a consultation on plans to replace the windfall tax on the profits of energy companies when it comes to an end in 2030. The Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced in May 2022 after companies recorded skyrocketing profits due to a sharp rise in energy prices. It was increased in the most recent UK government budget last year and means oil and gas producers are paying a headline tax rate of 78. The consultation seeks views on a new tax which would be triggered either when energy prices or profits are exceptionally high. The department for energy security and net zero said it would work to develop a plan that would deliver a fair return for the nation during times of unusually high prices. And it pledged to consult on a new regime for the industry in the North Sea, confirming new licences for oil and gas fields would not be approved. That comes after the UK government admitted plans for the Rosebank oil field off Shetland had been approved unlawfully after the decision was challenged in court by environmental campaigners. The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, said: The North Sea will be at the heart of Britains energy future. For decades, its workers, businesses and communities have helped power our country and our world. Oil and gas production will continue to play an important role and, as the world embraces the drive to clean energy, the North Sea can power our plan for change and clean energy future in the decades ahead. Oil and gas companies had posted record profits after wholesale prices spiked amid Russias invasion of Ukraine. The EPL was introduced by the previous Conservative government, which set the rate at 25 and put it in place until 2025. It was later increased to 35 by then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt and would run until at least 2029. Current chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that had been extended until at least 2030 and increased again by 3 in October 2024. The latest rise prompted the US-based firm Apache to announce it would end its North Sea operations by 2029. The company described the financial impact as onerous, adding continuing to operate in the area would be uneconomic. The price per barrel of oil has since fallen significantly. Trade association Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) previously warned the tax increase would stifle investment in the sector. Its chief executive, David Whitehouse, welcomed the news. He said: Todays consultations, on both the critical role of the North Sea in the energy transition and how the taxation regime will respond to unusually high oil and gas prices, will help to begin to give certainty to investors and create a stable investment environment for years to come. Alongside oil and gas production, the government said it wanted to ensure the North Sea would become a world-leading example for offshore clean energy. It said it was committed to working with the sector, trade unions and other organisations on a phased transition for the oil and gas industry.

It is Stop the Boats. Yet, in his first wide-ranging interview since leaving Downing Street, the former prime minister says he regrets ever saying it because it was too stark..too binary. And he concedes that it couldnt actually be delivered. This is just one of the lessons from Downing Street which the man who presided over the worst ever election defeat for the Conservative Party says hes learned, in a conversation lasting more than two hours for my Political Thinking podcast. It covers not only the mistakes he thinks he made, but also the disagreements about the right way to manage the economy that he had with Boris Johnson; the radical ideas he wishes he couldve implemented; the lessons he learned from being chancellor during the Covid pandemic - and his attitudes to race and faith and Englishness as the first British Asian prime minister. Sunak is in reflective mood talking about a job he was catapulted into, saying he didnt probably have the time to enjoy it in the moment or appreciate it in the moment because of the context in which I was doing it. That context was not just an economic crisis but a political one. The Tories were on their third leader in just 50 days, and thered been no election of party members or the wider public. I didnt have a mandate, he says, and defends his approach of trying to bring warring factions together. To do otherwise, he says, would have been a huge gamble because the thing just could have collapsed. And would that have been good for the country? I dont think so. I think what the country needed was stability. Hes not changed his mind about wanting to deport migrants who cross the channel to Rwanda, and says he now backs leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), if its not reformed. He says the court has taken on new powers. Theres been mission creep...It does need to reform or we should leave. When I asked him if he had taken his eye off the ball in regards to soaring levels of net migration, he concedes that although he took very strong action to bring the levels of legal migration downI should have done them sooner. Sunak was in many ways an accidental prime minister. It was October 2022, and he learned that Liz Truss had survived in the job for less time than that famous lettuce, whilst having a meal with his two daughters at TGIs in Teesside after a game of bowling. Four days later, he walked into Number 10 as her successor. He says he had very mixed feelingsgiven what had happened but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves doing your duty. Youve just got to focus on doing your best, doing what youre there to do, and not worry about the rest, he says. It was a very helpful concept for meI kept coming back to that. I said, look, this is my job. This is what Im here to do. Im well-placed to try and solve the economic challenge that our country is f...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9dxxgjx4do,2025-03-08
Chris Mason: Starmer finds subtle way to deal with Team Trump,"Week after week, there used to be a grim but poignant ritual at the start of Prime Ministers Question Time. The prime minister of the day would begin by acknowledging by name and by rank the British servicemen and women killed serving their country. But what happened this week was different. Not different in how it was done or the solemnity of the moment as MPs fell quiet and listened respectfully. But different because this time Sir Keir Starmer was marking the anniversaries of deaths rather than recent ones, which does not happen normally. And he was doing so intentionally to mark in actions, not commentary, what the government thought of the US Vice President JD Vances remarks about the military sacrifices of Americas allies. It is a case study in the dilemma UK ministers face: they are striving to have a close and productive relationship with a White House known for shooting its mouth off. No 10s approach is one of discretion and avoiding the temptation to commentate. Or to put it more crudely, dont get into a slanging match with Team Trump because you are certain to lose. So when European leaders were tapping out various levels of social media opprobrium on Friday evening after President Zelenskys bumpy meeting in Washington, Downing Street were not. The prime minister, we were later told, was on the phone to both President Trump and President Zelensky to try to patch things up. In other words, leveraging the relationship he has with both to try to move things forward: governing, not commentating. Now put yourself in the prime ministers shoes. You are determined to maintain this discipline because you believe it to be sensible, pragmatic and in the UKs national interest. But it is also true, according to opinion polls, that considerably more people in the UK are inclined to be critical of Donald Trump than supportive of him, particularly on his handling of Ukraine. In comparison, Sir Keirs approach is welcomed by many. But what do you do to deal with those who might think Sir Keir is being far too cosy with President Trump, and, crucially, what do you do when his team do something you might regard as egregiously indefensible? The other night JD Vance went on Fox News and claimed that the American plan for Ukraine offered a better security guarantee that 20,000 troops from some random country that hasnt fought a war in 30 or 40 years. There are only two countries that have publicly said that they would provide troops, the UK and France, neither of which the vice president mentioned. But plenty in the UK were outraged by the remarks, whether they were a reference to Britain or not. And the government found a mechanism, in co-opting and reviving a recent ritual, but this time to mark anniversaries, to make its view clear too. When us reporters asked the prime ministers team afterwards why they had done it, they stuck rigidly to their strategy: dont commentate. They didnt, and they didnt need to.

France has a nuclear umbrella. Could its European allies fit under it?,"So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right. As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence. Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours. In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant. From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of Frances sovereign nuclear deterrent  whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security. France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines. The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign  i.e. developed entirely by France  whereas the UK relies on US technical input. On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that Frances deterrence force (force de frappe) could  in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries. His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering sharing its nuclear arsenal. That  according to government officials as well as defence experts  is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be shared. According to Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent is French and will remain French  from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president. What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether Frances nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries. Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the vital interests of France were at stake. The limits of these vital interests have always been left deliberately vague  ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence. In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany. So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to Frances deterrent. What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it. In the past when France has made overtures about extending nuclear protection, other countries were reluctant to respond, says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille. They didnt want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato. But Trump has clarified the debate, Mr Laroche says. Its not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent  lets be clear,...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c871e41751yo,2025-03-08
How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare ahead of her Spring Statement, according to the BBC. When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: Our current situation is unsustainable weve seen a huge rise in that welfare budget. BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall. Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown. At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from 64.7bn in 2023-24 to 100.7bn in 2029-30. And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64. The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from 48.5bn in 2023-24 to 75.7bn in 2029-30. The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts. The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue. In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on. But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them. And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7 in 2024 to a record high of 7.9 in 2029. The reasons for this are not totally clear. Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health. Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30 increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable). Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work. The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is 311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have limited capacity for work-related activity, the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra 416.19 per month on top. But there is no consensus on whats causing the trend. It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase, says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately. Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element o...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crewng29zgno,2025-03-08
Mhairi Black - I was flailing in life until ADHD diagnosis,"From speeches watched by millions to a position as her partys deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars. However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was flailing through life and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC. Black believes it was only through a life-changing diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life. The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her partys performance at last years general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to self-inflected woes. Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20. She said her decision came after years in a toxic and bullying environment that was consuming my entire life, with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018. Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried, she told the BBCs Scotcast podcast. The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again. She said: I couldnt go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went. I didnt understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, Im just beating myself up more, because Im thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that cant cope with it? The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday - shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster. She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency. Westminster didnt have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like Ive no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house, she says. For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a life-changing impact on her life. She told Scotcast: It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, Im not mad, Im just wired differently. It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly. Black compares the condition to the BBCs Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatchs famous detective would use his mind palace to work out cases. It feels like theres constantly three conversations in my head  and a song, she laughs. However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it would get used against me in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by. She recalls: When she Mhairi started telling me about her experiences since...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crknngjpg26o,2025-03-08
Henry Zeffman: Proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments,"The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways. First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellors headroom has been eliminated. This is the 10bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules. Why has that headroom disappeared? The governments clear view is that this is because of global factors - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing. But there will be a big political argument about this. The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reevess Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth. Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government. Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget. Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures. Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts. Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to give families and business more certainty not only about tax but spending changes too. The government did reserve the right to change that approach in the case of an economic shock. Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock? There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts. Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable. There will be reform as well as cuts - Reeves has identified what she sees as perverse incentives in the system. In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship. Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice, they added. However others, including from the left of the party, said ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9degwx4p4jo,2025-03-08
What is stamp duty and how is it changing?,"Home buyers in England and Northern Ireland will pay more stamp duty after 1 April, when two key thresholds are reduced. Mortgage brokers have reported some potential buyers are pulling out of deals because they cannot complete before the end of March. Home buyers race to beat stamp duty rise The seven bills going up in April Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) is a tax due if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland, external. You have to pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than 250,000 dont pay any stamp duty. This limit was temporarily doubled from 125,000 in the September 2022 mini-Budget. The threshold for those buying their first property is 425,000 (when buying a home of less than 625,000), which was raised from 300,000 (when buying a home of less than 500,000), as part of the same mini-Budget.

Henry Zeffman: US aid pause raises stakes for Starmer,"President Trumps decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion. As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmers approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent. The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US. As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum. But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out. It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together. But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge. Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid. He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong. We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days. But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not. It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do. Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister. As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administrations decision and how it will work. And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume. Or, this may be the clearest example that - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different. Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by 20,000 troops from some random country that hasnt fought a war in 30 or 40 years. So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries. Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being. Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to tak...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn89663nqw0o,2025-03-08
Was Starmer's summit enough to sway  Trump?,"Lancaster House may have been bathed in sunshine as European leaders gathered to chart a way forward for Ukraine. But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London. It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine? The prime ministers answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US. He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraines own defensive capabilities, building up the countrys armed forces and border defences to ensure that Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself, according to the official conclusions of the summit. And Sir Keir said there would be a coalition of the willing to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace. Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be a force consisting of European and other partners. The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders. The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop. The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace. Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing. This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russians President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky. The Europeans also wanted to find ways of repairing the transatlantic alliance, which is looking pretty fragile after the confrontation between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday. In recent weeks, the US administration has gone after its European allies; questioning their democracy, voting against them at the United Nations and - in the form of the presidents chief enforcer, Elon Musk - saying even the US should leave the Nato military alliance. The summit in London was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. Diplomats said there was clear resolve around the table to support Ukraine but also to build on Trumps desire to find a ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn04551n6wpo,2025-03-08
Faisal Islam: Any Starmer deal with Trump is all about avoiding tariffs,"The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions. It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position. Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more. There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president, ripping off or screwing the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU. So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards. But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era. It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trumps own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU. It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table. In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its Brexit reset - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office. The narrower economic deal, as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the further integration of our two countries tech sectors. Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what Londons financial City became to New Yorks Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here. This strategy will have consequences. Trumps team are already railing against digital services taxes. The UKs digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2 charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces. While the 700m-1bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big techs revenues, many other countries have followed suit. The White House wants to stop the contagion, and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2 to 12 just four years ago. Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called freedom of speech issues. This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling fr...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedll3282qzo,2025-03-08
Chris Mason: Starmer wins Trump over - but Ukraine uncertainty lingers,"The prime ministers appointment with President Donald Trump, a wildly unpredictable showman of very different political hue, could so easily have been awkward, even excruciating. But it wasnt. As the Downing Street team return to the UK, they are happy with how it went. For some time senior figures were confident they had built a good rapport with Trump. They had hoped too that his love of the UK and the depth of the long standing ties between the two countries would stand them in good stead - but they couldnt be certain. Of course they couldnt be certain, because barely anyone ever can be with Trump. I have been to the White House a handful of times before, but I have never been on a visit like this one. Under President Joe Biden, us reporters would be invited into the Oval Office and then shown out minutes after we were shown in. But Trump, as the BBCs state department correspondent Tom Bateman described it to me when I arrived, is currently governing by news conference. He revels in the circus of performance and flurry of questions, his guests perched next to him occasionally chipping in, occasionally affecting a poker face - hoping there will be nothing said to them so outrageous they are forced to publicly contradict him. LIVE: Latest updates following Starmer-Trump meeting For Sir Keir Starmers visit, Trump cranked up the charm and the warmth. The prime minister cranked up the superlatives and the compliments - and while not quite matching French President Emmanuel Macrons backslapping and knee grabbing, he was more tactile than Ive ever seen him with any other leader. Starmer leant into the theatricality beloved of his host, brandishing - with some performative flourish - the letter from King Charles inviting the president for another state visit. It was stagecraft and statecraft combined in a single moment, neatly pitched for the scenario the prime minister found himself in. The presidents apparent endorsement of the governments plan to cede the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius and rent back the military base there on Diego Garcia - at considerable expense - was a perhaps unlikely fillip too. But the idea still faces opposition at home. The Conservatives question whether it serves the UKs national interest. The proposed UK-US deal Trump made mention of is expected to be narrow, with an initial focus at least on the technology sector. But there does remain considerable uncertainty about the practicalities of a peace plan for Ukraine. The prime minister talked about the importance of winning the peace and not merely stopping the fighting. The UK accepts there is no prospect whatsoever of American troops on the ground in Ukraine, but the government would like the US to provide air cover to protect British and other European peacekeepers. Europe will need to be assured the US has its back is the gist of the argument being made. But there has been no such public offer of air cover from the White House.

Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House. Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks. Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed. Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit. Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: Am I supposed to read it right now? After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an honour to visit the fantastic country. He added that King Charles was a beautiful man, a wonderful man. Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting Trumps letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean? During Trumps first term as president, he met King Charless mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019. Sir Keir said Thursdays invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was unprecedented. While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge. The meeting was a pattern weve now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there. During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trumps - dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters. A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other. Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keirs beautiful accent. At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trumps controversial call to make Canada  a member of the Commonwealth  the 51st state of the US. I think youre trying to find a divide that doesnt exist, Sir Keir replied. Trump interjected quickly with the words thats enough before moving on  again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir. To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance. But asked to name their similarities Trump said: He loves his country, and so do I. What else do they share? Trump said: We like each other, frankly, and we like each others country. But the common thread between the two men was that we love our country, Trump said. Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgee7rl24ro,2025-03-08
Did the White House help end the Tate brothers travel ban?,"Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case. Its unclear what, if any, role Donald Trumps administration may have played in their release, but one of Trumps top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romanias Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month. Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media. The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023. They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls defamatory and unequivocally false. On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending. Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings. When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: I know nothing about that. But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania. Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times. And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich. Hurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during that conversation, but denied being pressured to release the pair. The Tate brothers are Trump supporters and also have ties to figures in his administration. One of Tates lawyers now works as White House liaison to the US justice department. Paul Ingrassia was part of a team representing the Tate brothers in a defamation lawsuit they filed in Florida against several of their alleged victims. Ingrassia also acted as Tates publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host. He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate an extraordinary human being who was offering a dying West some hope for renewal. Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trumps orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk. Trump Jr once called Tates detention in Romania absolute insanity. Musk reinstated Andrew Tates account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.

UK looks at Texas supermax prison for ideas to cut overcrowding,"A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares. A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, Where you from, maam? England. Hope you enjoy Estelle, he says. Do you? I ask. A lot better than where I was before. Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter. The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. Theres a scheme here theyd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while theyre inside. Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released. Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment. No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row. Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. Hes already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. Hes a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery. Hes remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison. Im here for taking a life - and Im here to save multiple lives, he says. If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then Ive done my job - even if I never get out of prison. Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government. The good time credit scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, an...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr52399eqgqo,2025-03-08
Chris Mason: Starmer upends Labour manifesto to confront Europe's new reality,"A big moment and a big decision, ahead of a big meeting. The governments announcement that it will crank up defence spending and shrivel the international aid budget amounts to a big shift in strategy, posture and political positioning. Take a look at the Labour Partys election manifesto, written less than a year ago, if you would like proof of that. On page 125, it says: Labour is committed to restoring development spending at the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as soon as fiscal circumstances allow. The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite  cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it. There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind  and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic. Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later. But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence. The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy, as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russias invasion of Ukraine. A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance. Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two. Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean. The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trumps position. Over the coming weeks and months, can a deal be done where the war stops, Ukraine does not feel defeated, Europe does not feel imperilled and transatlantic relations are as near to conventional as possible? It is not going to be easy. The prime ministers trip to the White House is but one building block in developing answers to these questions. And then, over the following weekend, Starmer will host a gathering of European leaders to reflect on where the conversations so far have taken us. President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected in Washington soon too. The next few weeks could prove crucial.

Sinn Féin St Patrick's Day move over Trump policy a gamble,"Boycotting the St Patricks Day celebrations in the White House is a big call by Sinn Féin. Such a snub risks damaging long-standing relationships with key political figures in the US. It could also play badly with the wider Irish diaspora, many of whom are big supporters of Donald Trump. But it is a gamble Sinn Féins leadership are prepared to take. Politically it will feel like the right thing to do given President Trumps previous threat to remove Palestinians from Gaza and attack on Ukraine this week. At the start of the month, Trump put forward a drastic shift in American policy towards the Middle East saying the US will take over the Gaza Strip and turn it into the Riviera of the region. A wave of international criticism met the comments - including from France, Germany and the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who has warned the US against ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Earlier this week, he accused Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky of being a dictator who started the war with Russia. For many it was a step too far, even for those within the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) who had fully supported the new Trump administration. But governments had to walk a thin line by criticising Trumps remarks while not damaging relations with the US. Trumps attacks came after Zelensky, reacting to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia from which Kyiv was excluded, said the US president was living in a disinformation space governed by Moscow. Oppositions parties like Sinn Féin had no such constraints. Eight Irish ministers are travelling to the US next month including Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin. It will feel like an easy hit for Sinn Féin given the wider public outrage against President Trump. But the decision by Northern Irelands first minister to announce her Washington boycott in Dublin will not be lost on her unionist political opponents. For them this will feel like a political strategy born in Dublin and not Belfast. The focus will now fall on Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly who was keen to travel to Washington. Though it is a joint office, she could still travel to the US as long as the move is not vetoed by the first minister which seems unlikely. If that happens Northern Ireland will be represented in the White House but not by the joint ministers.",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd354xjnl2o,2025-03-08
The Chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP,"Rachel Reeves has had a difficult start to her ministerial career. As well as Labours new chancellor taking on the challenges of the UK economy, she has faced tricky questions about her past. They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year. On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed to have worked as an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) immediately before becoming an MP. One of those who challenged it was a retired former colleague, Kev Gillett. In a public post on LinkedIn, which he asked followers to share, he wrote: Back in 2009 Rt Hon Rachel Reeves worked 3 levels below me. Just facts. She was a Complaints Support Manager at LBGHBOS. Not an Economist. factcheck. In fact it emerged that she had worked in a managerial role within the banks complaint handling department and her LinkedIn profile was updated to remove the claim. Rachel Reevess online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England Gillett also made another claim about Reevess time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses. Reevess team vigorously denied the allegations. However, Labours imminent victory in last summers general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves. One former employee replied: the expenses dept certainly do! Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending. BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents. We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers. A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the banks money to fund a lifestyle with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other. We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded. But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the banks risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblowers allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation. A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms. Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006. The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labours parliamentary ...",Politics,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg75jr5284o,2025-03-08
Who is Rachel Reeves?,"Rachel Reeves has had a bumpy first few months in government. Her tax-hiking Budget prompted criticism from businesses and farmers, and despite Labour putting a pledge to boost the economy at the centre of its plans, growth has been sluggish. Now the chancellor is facing questions about whether she exaggerated her experience on her online CV and her use of expenses while working in the banking sector before she became an MP. Reeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change. She has previously told the BBC her mother would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: We werent poor, but we didnt have money to waste. Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes. During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering. They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money. Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Browns prudence in the lead-up to Labours 1997 election win. Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would quietly thrash any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie. She has credited chess with teaching her to think ahead, to plan a strategy. A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenhams Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level. Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of two pre-fab huts in the playground, she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party. She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destinys Child songs and dressing up in her room. Despite her serious demeanour, colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MPs public persona does not reflect her human side, including a loud laugh and a deep love of Beyoncé tracks. Age: 46 Place of birth: Lewisham, south-east London Education: New College, Oxford and the London School of Economics Family: Married to Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant and former speechwriter to Gordon Brown during his time as chancellor.

"Trump’s Tariffs Could Help Tesla, by Hurting Its Rivals More","As President Trump puts new tariffs on goods from China and threatens a trade war with allies like Mexico and Canada, one global company is likely to suffer less than most of its competitors: Tesla. But the electric car maker led by Elon Musk, which accounts for a third of the billionaires wealth, is also vulnerable if relations with China worsen. That country is the companys second-largest market after the United States and it produces more cars there than anywhere else. Tesla has built largely self-sufficient supply chains in the United States and China, a rarity in a world of interconnected trade. As a result, the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods, and the continuing threat to put them on Mexican and Canadian products, might help Tesla by hurting its competitors more. Although there is no evidence that Mr. Musk is shaping trade policies, the tariffs are one of several measures adopted by the Trump administration that may benefit Tesla at the expense of its rivals. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump paused 25 percent tariffs on most autos and parts made in Canada and Mexico, but the reprieve expires in a month, leaving automakers in the United States that depend on foreign supply chains in a state of uncertainty. The administration is also trying to eliminate financial support for the construction of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles, a move that could handicap companies seeking to compete with Teslas extensive network. And it is attempting to cut or eliminate loans and subsidies that competitors like Ford Motor and Rivian are using to finance electric vehicle and battery factories.

China Hits Canada With Tariffs in Indirect Riposte to Trump,"China announced tariffs of up to 100 percent on canola, pork and other foods from Canada on Saturday, in retaliation for Canadas decision last August to collect steep taxes on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, steel and aluminum. The Chinese tariffs, which take effect on March 20, were also a clear warning to Canada  and, indirectly, Mexico  not to cooperate with the United States on trade. The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has been demanding that Canada and Mexico not serve as back doors for low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. market under North American free trade agreements. Chinas State Council Tariff Commission announced on Saturday that it would impose tariffs of 100 percent on canola oil, which is Canadas largest export to China, and on peas, and 25 percent on Canadian pork and seafood. The commission said the measures were in response to Canadas 100 percent tariffs on electric cars from China and its 25 percent tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, which took effect in October. Chinas Ministry of Commerce said in a separate statement that China urges Canada to immediately correct its wrong practices, lift restrictive measures and eliminate adverse effects. The Canadian government had no immediate comment. The Chinese agencies statements were carefully worded to comply with World Trade Organization rules and did not mention any effort to influence Canada or Mexico during their current trade discussions with the United States. But a commentary released by Chinas state television left little doubt that a key goal for China is dissuading officials in Ottawa and Mexico City from acceding to American pressure for higher Canadian and Mexican tariffs on Chinese goods. The Chinese tariffs are a powerful countermeasure to Canadas wrong choice, and a strong warning to some countries that intend to impose additional tariffs on China in exchange for the United States not to impose additional tariffs on them, China Central Television said.

Trump Seeks to Bar Student Loan Relief to Workers Aiding Migrants and Trans Kids,"President Trump signed an executive order instructing administration officials to alter a student loan forgiveness program for public servants to exclude nonprofit organizations that engage in activities that have what he called a substantial illegal purpose. His order to restrict the program appears to target groups supporting undocumented immigrants, diversity initiatives or gender-affirming care for children, among others, as the Trump administration has sought to eliminate federal support for efforts that have drawn right-wing ire. The order, made public on Friday, is the latest of many attempts to overhaul the loan forgiveness program, which has often whipsawed borrowers with rule changes and bureaucratic obstacles. The program, known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, was created by Congress in 2007 and cannot be eliminated without congressional action, but the Education Department has some leeway to determine how it operates. Mr. Trumps executive order directed the secretaries of education and the Treasury to amend the program to exclude workers for organizations supporting illegal actions, listing several categories of examples, including aiding or abetting violations of federal immigration law. The Trump administration has taken a broad view of what it considers to be support of illegal activities. The order cited as examples organizations that support illegal discrimination, which the administration has previously said includes diversity and inclusion initiatives. The order appeared to target groups supporting gender-affirming care. It said it would exclude from the loan forgiveness program any organization supporting child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.

Trump Offers to Reopen Nuclear Talks in a Letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader,"President Trump said on Friday that he had sent a letter to Irans supreme leader offering to reopen negotiations over the countrys fast-advancing nuclear program, but warned that the country would have to choose between curbing its fast-expanding program or losing it in a military attack. Speaking on Friday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump suggested that Irans nuclear capabilities  which now include enough near-bomb-grade fuel to produce about six weapons  were reaching a critical point. Were down to final strokes with Iran, he told reporters. We cant let them have a nuclear weapon. Earlier on Friday on Fox Business, Mr. Trump said: There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because Im not looking to hurt Iran. Theyre great people. He said the letter was sent Wednesday and addressed to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Irans supreme leader. The White House did not provide the text or describe its contents with any specificity. It was unclear if it was sent through the Swiss  the traditional intermediary for communications between Washington and Tehran  or through Russia or another nation. Mr. Trumps offer echoes a similar message to Iran during his first term, after he announced in 2018 that he was pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal that had been negotiated three years earlier by the Obama administration. But he never got talks started, and an effort by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. collapsed. Now, the strategic environment has changed radically. The Justice Department has accused Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of seeking to assassinate Mr. Trump last year; it issued indictments before Mr. Biden left office. Irans nuclear facilities are now exposed to attack, after Israel destroyed almost all of the air defenses protecting them in October. And Irans regional proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, are in no condition to threaten Israel with retaliation should the Iranian facilities come under attack.

C.D.C. Will Investigate Debunked Link Between Vaccines and Autism,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to conduct a large-scale study to re-examine whether there is a connection between vaccines and autism, federal officials said Friday. Dozens of scientific studies have failed to find evidence of a link. But the C.D.C. now falls under the purview of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long expressed skepticism about the safety of vaccines and has vowed to revisit the data. As President Trump said in his Joint Address to Congress, the rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. C.D.C. will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening, Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement Friday. Mr. Nixon did not offer details about the scope or methods of the project. News of the study was first reported Friday morning by Reuters. In pursuing the study, the C.D.C. is defying the wishes of the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy, who said this week that further research into any supposed link between vaccines and autism would be a waste of money and a distraction from research that might shed light on the true reason for a rise in autism rates. Its been exhaustively studied, Mr. Cassidy, a doctor, said during the confirmation hearing for Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, President Trumps nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health.

Trump Administration Sends Politically Charged Survey to Researchers,"The Trump administration has asked researchers and organizations whose work is conducted overseas to disclose ties to those regarded as hostile, including entities associated with communist, socialist or totalitarian parties, according to a questionnaire obtained by The New York Times. The online survey was sent this week to groups working abroad to research diseases like H.I.V., gather surveillance data and strengthen public health systems. Recipients received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Agency for International Development and other federal sources. The questionnaire appears to be very similar to one sent earlier this week to partners of the United States Agency for International Development, which has been all but dismantled by the Trump administration. Both were titled Foreign Assistance Review. Recipients were instructed to respond within 48 hours. Some grantees interviewed by The Times feared that impolitic or unsatisfactory answers could lead to cancellation of funding. Taxpayer dollars must not fund dependency, socialism, corrupt regimes that oppose free enterprise, or intervene in internal matters of another sovereign nation, the questionnaire said.

Homeland Security Department to End Union Contract with TSA Workers,"The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it was ending its collective bargaining agreement with workers in the Transportation Security Administration, claiming that the union contract was imperiling the safety of travelers. The move was the latest step by President Trumps administration to undermine labor protections for federal workers, and prompted an outraged response from the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents some 47,000 at the T.S.A., along with hundreds of thousands of other federal workers. The union vowed to fight the action, saying that it had little do with safety and appeared to be illegal. The move could lay the groundwork for the government to fire T.S.A. workers and perhaps even privatize the agency, according to labor experts. Project 2025, a conservative policy playbook that Mr. Trump distanced himself from during the presidential campaign but has since followed, called for privatizing the T.S.A. The T.S.A., which has about 50,000 workers in the field and makes up about a quarter of the Homeland Security Departments work force, is tasked with securing the nations airports, highways and passenger rail system. It was created in 2002 in response to the Sept. 11 attacks and folded into the Homeland Security Department in 2003. In a statement on Friday, the Homeland Security Department claimed that a select few poor performers in the T.S.A. were exploiting benefits and suggested that too many employees were devoting time to union matters rather than security work. Eliminating collective bargaining removes bureaucratic hurdles, the statement said, adding that the union had constrained efforts to keep Americans safe. Everett Kelley, the unions president, said in a statement that this action has nothing to do with efficiency, safety or homeland security. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

What the Recent Cabinet Blowup Means for Musk,"Yesterday, President Trump did something hes seemingly been loath to do in the first seven weeks of his new administration: He reined in Elon Musk. My colleagues Jonathan Swan and Maggie Haberman have the details of the extraordinary cabinet meeting where everything unfolded, and youre going to want to read every word. After Musk berated Secretary of State Marco Rubio for having fired nobody, Rubio pushed back while Trump watched. Musk scoffed that Rubio was merely good on TV. Sean Duffy, a former star of MTVs Real World who knows what it means to be good on television  and is now the secretary of transportation  played his own role in the conflict earlier in the meeting, when he spoke in defense of air traffic controllers, some of whom, he said, Musks aides were trying to fire. What was clear was that some of the nations cabinet secretaries had hit their breaking point with Musks efforts to steamroll the federal government. And while Trump said he still supported Musks mission, he gave his secretaries something they wanted. As Jonathan and Maggie wrote: From now on, he said, the secretaries would be in charge; the Musk team would only advise. The encounter stood as the first indication that Trump is willing to put some limits on the billionaire, even if those limits would do little more than bring the realities of Musks wide-ranging role more in line with how the administrations lawyers have described it in court. But the limits, if they hold, could raise bigger questions about the role Musk will play in the government going forward  especially if his history in the business world is any guide. Ryan Mac, a colleague of mine who covers big tech, has reported on Musk for a long time. Today, I asked him if Musk had ever been content with an adviser-style role, one in which he doesnt run the show. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump Administration Forces Out More Senior Justice Dept. Officials,"The Trump administration on Friday forced out a handful of senior Justice Department officials, further thinning the ranks of career officials who help guide the agency, according to several people familiar with the actions. The ouster of lawyers managing the Justice Departments pardon work, bankruptcy litigation and other legal issues marks the latest move by the new administration to remove or reassign senior officials with many years of experience. The official overseeing the Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles internal ethics investigations, was also removed from that role, though he was placed on administrative leave, these people said. The removals follow a pattern that has fueled turmoil and alarm inside the Justice Department as the new administration seeks to take control of the agency and reshape it with an emphasis on loyalty to President Trump. The Justice Departments pardon attorney, Elizabeth Oyer, posted on LinkedIn that she had been fired from the job I have poured my heart and soul into for the last three years. In the post, she shared her dismissal letter, which was signed by the newly confirmed deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, a former criminal defense lawyer for Mr. Trump. Two Justice Department spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Attorney General Pam Bondi has vowed to end what she calls the weaponization of the department, claiming without much explanation or evidence that prosecutors improperly pursued criminal cases against Mr. Trump during the Biden administration. Critics of the Trump administrations recent personnel changes inside the Justice Department argue that they will significantly weaken the authority of career law enforcement officials, and instead empower pro-Trump partisans to pursue the presidents goal of punishing his perceived enemies.

"At Crypto Summit, Trump Says U.S. Will Be ‘the Bitcoin Superpower’","Sitting beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, more than two dozen of the most powerful figures in the U.S. cryptocurrency industry, together worth many billions of dollars, gathered in the White House on Friday for an audience with President Trump. When Mr. Trump entered the ornate State Dining Room after a short wait, the executives rose to applaud him. Many of you have been fighting for years for this, Mr. Trump said as the room quieted. Its an honor to be with you at the White House. Mr. Trump was holding a first-of-its-kind crypto summit, meeting face to face with the leaders of virtually all of the top crypto companies in the United States. Only a small portion of the gathering, which was scheduled to last four hours, was broadcast to the public. But it offered a vivid illustration of Mr. Trumps recent embrace of crypto, a renegade industry that has spent years battling with U.S. regulators. Several executives, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, offered words of gratitude to Mr. Trump. They called him wonderful, saying they were overjoyed with his approach. High I.Q. individuals around this table, Mr. Trump responded. Since he took office, Mr. Trump has orchestrated a complete transformation of federal policy on crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission has almost entirely reversed an aggressive campaign by the Biden administration to crack down on the industry. The agency, moving with astonishing speed, has issued legal guidance to help crypto companies, ended investigations into major firms and dropped lawsuits against two of the largest exchanges, Coinbase and Kraken.

Trump’s Delay on Mexico and Canada Tariffs Came in Response to Market Revolt,"A month ago, President Trump announced that he would impose sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico before reaching a last-minute deal to delay them for 30 days. This week, after markets revolted when the tariffs were put in place, Mr. Trump watered them down with a monthlong reprieve for automakers. And then on Thursday, he opened up even broader exemptions for many other products that are imported from Americas neighbors to the north and south after intense lobbying from business groups that warned of rising prices. Mr. Trump has spent the last month or so bouncing between imposing sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and delaying them because of last-minute deals. There will, he said, always be changes and adjustments. Despite Mr. Trumps insistence that tariff is among his favorite words, the waffling over import duties reflects the reality that steep import taxes are not an antidote for every policy problem facing the nation. Mr. Trumps economic advisers continue to contend that the tariffs are part of a broader agenda that will not damage the economy. However, the delays and loopholes reveal that they are beginning to see the risks of taking tariffs too far at a time when the economy is showing signs of strain and consumers are still reeling from inflation.

Lawyers Plan to Sue Federal Government on Behalf of Jan. 6 Rioters,"A team of lawyers is preparing to sue the federal government on behalf of hundreds of people pardoned by President Trump for their role in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, claiming that the rioters were mistreated by agencies like the Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons. The lawyers leading the effort include Mark McCloskey, who rose to prominence five years ago after he pointed an AR-15-style rifle at social justice protesters outside his home in St. Louis, and Peter Ticktin, a former classmate and longtime ally of Mr. Trump. Even before Mr. Trump granted clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people prosecuted in connection with Jan. 6, many defendants had been itching to seek damages from the federal government. The presidents sweeping reprieves have only emboldened them in their efforts to claim they are the victims, not the perpetrators, of the attack. Any attempt to sue the federal government over Jan. 6 could face an uphill climb in court, although in this instance the lawyers could be aided by the government itself. It remains unclear at this point how Justice Department officials appointed by Mr. Trump might handle a case claiming that federal prosecutors, F.B.I. agents and prison guards mistreated Jan. 6 defendants. The department could decide not to mount a robust defense and simply seek to settle any claims before they go to trial. A handful of rioters  including one with ties to the Proud Boys and another with connections to the Oath Keepers militia  have already filed suit against federal officials and local law enforcement agencies in Washington. But those cases have not gained much traction in the courts. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Trump Organization Sues Capital One for Closing Its Accounts,"President Trumps family business sued Capital One on Friday for unjustifiably terminating more than 300 of its bank accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the latest sign that the president and his allies are seeking retribution against those who once shunned them. In a complaint filed in state court in Florida, the Trump Organization accused the bank of arbitrarily closing its accounts in June 2021 in violation of various consumer protection laws. The accounts held millions of dollars at the time, according to the lawsuit. By filing this lawsuit, we seek to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods, the company said in a statement. The bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, did not provide a reason at the time for closing the accounts, the lawsuit said. But in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when Mr. Trumps supporters stormed the Capitol, a number of financial institutions cut ties with his familys real estate business. The groups lawsuit against Capital One could portend similar actions against other banks. More to come, Eric Trump, one of the plaintiffs and the leader of the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Friday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How Foreign Aid Cuts Are Setting the Stage for Disease Outbreaks,"Dangerous pathogens left unsecured at labs across Africa. Halted inspections for mpox, Ebola and other infections at airports and other checkpoints. Millions of unscreened animals shipped across borders. The Trump administrations pause on foreign aid has hobbled programs that prevent and snuff out outbreaks around the world, scientists say, leaving people everywhere more vulnerable to dangerous pathogens. That includes Americans. Outbreaks that begin overseas can travel quickly: The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, for example, but it soon appeared everywhere, including the United States. When polio or dengue appears in this country, cases are usually linked to international travel. Its actually in the interest of American people to keep diseases down, said Dr. Githinji Gitahi, who heads Amref Health Africa, a large nonprofit that relies on the United States for about 25 percent of its funding. Diseases make their way to the U.S. even when we have our best people on it, and now we are not putting our best people on it, he added. In interviews, more than 30 current and former officials of the United States Agency for International Development, members of health organizations and experts in infectious diseases described a world made more perilous than it was just a few weeks ago.

Trump ‘Strongly Considering’ New Sanctions on Russia to Force Cease-Fire Deal,"President Trump said on Friday that he was strongly considering imposing sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and permanent peace deal was reached in its war with Ukraine, even as he defended Russias stepped-up attacks on Ukraine after the United States paused aid and intelligence sharing. Asked in the Oval Office on Friday whether he believed Mr. Putin was taking advantage of the situation, which resulted from a tense Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine last month, Mr. Trump defended Mr. Putins actions, saying hes doing what anybody else would do. I think hes hitting him harder than hes been hitting him, Mr. Trump said. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now. It was the latest about-face for Mr. Trump, coming just hours after threatening sanctions, but also a return to aligning himself with President Vladimir V. Putins narrative of the war. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has falsely accused Kyiv of starting it, even though Ukraine was invaded by Russia, and accused Mr. Zelensky of being the dictator who didnt want peace. Mr. Trumps remarks came hours after Russia unleashed a furious bombardment aimed at critical Ukrainian infrastructure overnight on Thursday and Friday. Ukraines energy minister, German Galushchenko, said Russian forces launched a massive missile and drone assault on power and gas facilities across the country. In an early morning post announced on his social media site, Truth Social, Mr. Trump said he was strongly considering imposing what he described as large scale sanctions, including on banks, because of the perilous state of the war, now in its fourth year.

Powell Says the Fed Is in No Hurry to Adjust Rates Amid Trump Policy Uncertainty,"Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said the central bank is focused on the net effect of President Trumps sweeping economic agenda amid high uncertainty about which policies will actually be enacted, as he reiterated that officials are still not in a hurry to adjust interest rates. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves, Mr. Powell said at an event on Friday. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity. If inflation stays sticky but the economy remains strong, the Fed chair said the central bank can maintain policy restraint for longer. But if either the labor market were to weaken more than expected, or inflation were to rapidly decline, Mr. Powell said officials can ease policy accordingly. His comments underscore the delicate balancing act that Fed is trying to navigate at a tenuous moment for the economy. In an interview on Friday, Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed and a voting member on this years policy-setting committee, warned that a situation in which inflation stayed sticky while growth deteriorated at the same time would be a harder problem for the Fed to solve and something that is increasingly on the radar screen as a result of the policies that Mr. Trump is pursuing. Tariffs on intermediate goods are a negative supply shock, he said, referring to goods that are used to make other products and services for consumers. If there were large negative supply shocks that were to hit the economy, they would have a tendency to both drive down employment and drive up prices.

Rubio and Trump Officials Clash With Elon Musk in an Explosive Meeting,"Marco Rubio was incensed. Here he was in the Cabinet Room of the White House, the secretary of state, seated beside the president and listening to a litany of attacks from the richest man in the world. Seated diagonally opposite, across the elliptical mahogany table, Elon Musk was letting Mr. Rubio have it, accusing him of failing to slash his staff. You have fired nobody, Mr. Musk told Mr. Rubio, then scornfully added that perhaps the only person he had fired was a staff member from Mr. Musks Department of Government Efficiency. Mr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubios control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting on Thursday in front of President Trump and around 20 others  details of which have not been reported before  Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest. Mr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement in buyouts? Didnt they count as layoffs? He asked, sarcastically, whether Mr. Musk wanted him to rehire all those people just so he could make a show of firing them again. Then he laid out his detailed plans for reorganizing the State Department. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon Says We Don’t Need the Agency,"Education Secretary Linda McMahon delivered a stark message on Friday about the future of her agency. Asked on Fox  Friends whether the United States needs this department, Ms. McMahon answered: No, we dont. In the interview, her first since she was confirmed to her cabinet post this week, Ms. McMahon said that President Trump intended to sign an executive order aimed at closing her department, but she declined to give details on timing. She also did not address how the administration might persuade lawmakers to go along. The department cannot be closed without the approval of Congress. Such a move, in a closely divided Senate, would require support from Democrats, which appears unlikely after Ms. McMahon was confirmed along party lines. During the previous session of Congress, a proposal to eliminate the department failed in the Republican-controlled House when 60 Republicans voted against it. Asked about her message to parents and students concerned about what might happen should the department be eliminated, Ms. McMahon said, We will see scores go up. Republicans have pushed to close the agency by arguing that student test scores have not improved despite decades of funding from the federal government. Ms. McMahon has said she does not want to cut money for schools, but would rather deliver that funding to states with fewer restrictions. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump Says He Wrote to Iran to Open Nuclear Talks,"President Trump said he had sent a letter to the Iranian government seeking to negotiate a deal to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. He said the letter was sent Wednesday and addressed to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Irans supreme leader. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to provide the letter or further describe its contents. Irans mission to the United Nations said on Friday that Iran had received no such letter to date. Speaking on Friday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump suggested that Irans nuclear capabilities were reaching a critical point. Were down to final strokes with Iran, he said, adding, We cant let them have a nuclear weapon. In an interview that aired earlier on Friday on Fox Business, Mr. Trump said: There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because Im not looking to hurt Iran. Theyre great people. The move is a sharp pivot for Mr. Trump, who in 2018 withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran, unraveling a signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor, Barack Obama. In the interview, with the Fox host Maria Bartiromo, Mr. Trump described his letter as saying, I hope youre going to negotiate because its going to be a lot better for Iran.

"Fort Liberty Renamed Fort Bragg, Fulfilling a Trump Campaign Promise","The sprawling Army base in North Carolina had long been named for Braxton Bragg, an incompetent Confederate general who owned enslaved people. Then in 2020, Congress moved to strip the base of its name, mandating a new one. The base was renamed Fort Liberty as part of the U.S. militarys examination of its history with race. But Mr. Trump and other conservatives raged against the changes, arguing that wokeness was softening the military and wiping away important elements of American tradition and heritage. Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to restore the old name, and his pledge was brought to fruition on Friday, but with a twist that seemed both a rewriting of history and an internet troll: Fort Liberty again became Fort Bragg, not in honor of the Confederate general but in memory of Pvt. Roland L. Bragg, a previously obscure infantryman who had served at Fort Bragg and fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II. The official ceremony at the military base on Friday cemented a political victory for Mr. Trump, who suffered a legislative defeat in 2020 when Congress pushed past his veto of a bill with a provision to rename nine Army bases that had honored treasonous Confederate generals who fought against the United States to preserve slavery and white supremacy. Those bases were renamed for candidates that embody the best of the United States Army, according to the naming commission that recommended the initial changes. They included decorated officers, enlisted troops who survived harrowing trials in battle, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and one civilian: Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, a Civil War surgeon and the only woman ever awarded a Medal of Honor. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Private Prisons Are Ramping Up Detention of Immigrants and Cashing In,"Damon Hininger, the chief executive of CoreCivic, which operates private prisons and immigrant detention centers, opened an investor call last month on a buoyant note. Ive worked at CoreCivic for 32 years, and this is truly one of the most exciting periods in my career, he said, adding that the company was anticipating in the next several years perhaps the most significant growth in our companys history. CoreCivic, GEO Group and some smaller private prison companies are becoming a key cog in the Trump administrations plan to hold and then deport vast numbers of undocumented immigrants.

Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook,"President Trump inherited an economy that was, by most conventional measures, firing on all cylinders. Wages, consumer spending and corporate profits were rising. Unemployment was low. The inflation rate, though higher than normal, was falling. Just weeks into Mr. Trumps term, the outlook is gloomier. Measures of business and consumer confidence have plunged. The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Layoffs are picking up, according to some data. And forecasters are cutting their estimates for economic growth this year, with some even predicting that the U.S. gross domestic product could shrink in the first quarter. Some commentators have gone further, arguing that the economy could be headed for a recession, a sharp rebound in inflation or even the dreaded combination of the two, stagflation. Most economists consider that unlikely, saying growth is more likely to slow than to give way to a decline. Still, the sudden deterioration in the outlook is striking, especially because it is almost entirely a result of Mr. Trumps policies and the resulting uncertainty. Tariffs, and the inevitable retaliation from trading partners, will increase prices and slow down growth. Federal job cuts will push up unemployment, and could lead government employees and contractors to pull back on spending while they wait to learn their fate. Deportations could drive up costs for industries like construction and hospitality that depend on immigrant labor. If the economy was starting out in quite good shape, its probably in less good shape after what weve seen the last few weeks, said Donald Rissmiller, chief economist at Strategas, a research firm. The U.S. economy has repeatedly shown its resilience in recent years, and there are parts of Mr. Trumps agenda that could foster growth. Business groups have responded enthusiastically to Republican plans to cut taxes and reduce regulation. A streamlined government could, in theory, make the overall economy more productive.

"Republican Voters Support Medicaid but Want Work Requirements, Poll Finds","As Congressional Republicans weigh major cuts to Medicaid, most voters do not want to see the public health plans funding dialed back, according to a poll released Friday by KFF, a nonpartisan health research firm. Just 17 percent of respondents said they supported cuts to Medicaid, the government health insurance program that covers more than 70 million people. Forty percent said they wanted to keep spending unchanged, and 42 percent said they would like it increased. But at the same time, the poll found significant support for certain policies that would limit the program, such as requiring enrollees to work. More than 60 percent of voters  and 47 percent of Democrats  supported a work requirement, the poll found. That change, which has been championed by some congressional Republicans, is estimated to cut about 100 billion from Medicaid, as those who were unemployed  or could not file the paperwork showing they had a job  would no longer be covered. The programs cost was 584 billion in 2024, or about 8 percent of total federal spending. As Republicans weigh deep cuts, these congressional districts  some red, some blue  have the most to lose. The poll also illustrated Medicaids wide reach, with just over half of respondents saying that either they or a family member had at one point had Medicaid coverage. There was nearly universal agreement that Medicaid mattered to voters local communities, with 98 percent of Democrats and 94 percent of Republicans saying they thought it was somewhat or very important.

"US support to maintain UK’s nuclear arsenal is in doubt, experts say","Malcolm Rifkind joins diplomats and analysts urging focus on European cooperation to replace Trident Britains ability to rely on the US to maintain the UKs nuclear arsenal is now in doubt, experts have warned, but working with European states to replace it will be costly and take time. An existing debate about the future of Trident  Britains ageing submarine-launched nuclear missile system  has taken a dramatic new turn in recent weeks amid fears Donald Trump could pull out of Nato. A range of concerns had already loomed over the 3bn-a-year programme, not least around its efficiency and effectiveness after a second embarrassing failed test launch last year. Costs have also been a longstanding challenge but replacing Vanguard submarines on time has been prioritised over coming in under budget. Downing Street sought to play down concerns earlier this week after diplomatic figures including the former British ambassador to the US Sir David Manning floated the scenario of an end to Anglo-US nuclear cooperation. However, calls for Britain to make alternative plans have been joined by the former UK foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who initiated talks in the 90s between the UK and France on nuclear weapons cooperation. It really is necessary for Britain and France to work more closely together because if American reliability ever came into question, then Europe could be defenceless in the face of Russian aggression, he said. The contribution by America must now be to some degree in doubt, not today or tomorrow, but over the next few years and certainly as long as Trump and people like him are in control in Washington. A No 10 spokesperson insisted this week that Keir Starmer viewed the US as a reliable ally, saying: The UKs nuclear deterrent is completely operationally independent. Yet the UK is  unlike France  highly intertwined with the US when it comes to maintaining its nuclear weapons, which are designed, manufactured and maintained in the US under a deal rooted in a 1958 agreement. Britain had 50 missiles left as of 2008 after purchases from a US stockpile, according to research by the University of Bradford. Britain likes to call its nuclear posture independent, but it, of course, is absolutely not, said Hans Kristensen, who monitors the status of nuclear forces for the Federation of American Scientists, a US thinktank. It may be that Britain can fire weapons independently of the US, but below that, the entire infrastructure covering missile compartments on submarines, the missiles themselves, all are supplied by the Americans. Defence analysts are emphasising the need to plan for a scenario where a transatlantic relationship fractures to the extent that the US declines to give the UK missiles.

London councils buy £140m of property to move homeless people out of city,"Exclusive: More than a dozen authorities have bought more than 850 properties in English towns and cities since 2017 London councils and housing companies they own have spent more than 140m buying up homes to relocate homeless people out of the city. More than a dozen councils in the capital have collectively spent millions buying up more than 850 properties in towns and cities across England since 2017, Guardian analysis of property ownership data found. The homes are either owned directly by councils or by companies they partly or wholly own. They are used to house homeless individuals and families, either temporarily in emergency accommodation or permanently in privately rented homes. Most of the homes are in deprived areas in the south-east and east of England that are already under huge pressures due to homelessness among their own residents. But in the past year London councils have looked farther afield, buying up a small number of properties in the Midlands and laying out plans to buy more in north-east England. Housing charities said families lives were thrown into turmoil by being moved away from their communities. Labour MPs urged the government to reconsider its approach to the scarring out-of-area placements, which are at their highest levels since records began. Waltham Forest and Bromley councils, via companies they jointly own with the housing and social care company Mears Group, have collectively spent almost 80m buying more than 500 homes in areas including Harlow and Thurrock in Essex and Maidstone in Kent since 2017. Both councils use these properties to discharge their homelessness duties and permanently rehouse people out of London. Brent council has spent more than 18m buying 75 properties across Milton Keynes, Hemel Hempstead and Slough, while Barnet council has spent more than 10m buying nearly 70 properties in Peterborough and Luton. Brent and Barnet used companies they wholly owned to make these purchases since 2017. Housing Gateway, a company wholly owned by Enfield council, spent 13m in 2018 buying Greenway House, a converted office block on the outskirts of Harlow with 83 flats that are used as temporary accommodation. The Guardian previously revealed that councils had paid millions to relocation companies to help them permanently move homeless people to the Midlands and north of England. Recent property purchases suggest that some London councils are starting to move the practice in-house. In December, Enfield council laid out plans to buy 28 homes through Housing Gateway around Liverpool this year. It said these properties would initially be used as temporary accommodation with the aim of finding homeless households long-term housing in the area once relocated. Redbridge council, which has spent more than 10m buying 55 properties outside the capital since 2020, has bought homes 100 miles away in Coventry and Leicester in the past year. They are being used as temporary accommodation but the council said it planned t...",Politics,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/08/london-councils-buy-140m-property-move-homeless-people-out-city,2025-03-08
Britain’s biggest unions call for much closer UK-EU ties amid ‘volatile’ global economy,"Exclusive: union umbrella body calls for new cooperation agreement ahead of Keir Starmers reset talks with Brussels The UK should forge much closer ties with Europe amid an increasingly volatile and unpredictable global economy, Britains biggest trade unions will argue as they push for new workers rights across the continent. In its first major intervention on Europe in five years, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) will call for a much-needed closer relationship with the EU, in a joint statement with European counterparts. Ahead of Keir Starmers reset talks with Brussels, the union umbrella body will say negotiations must cover new opportunities for quality jobs for UK workers in the EU and for EU workers in the UK, though it will stop short of calling for a return to freedom of movement. Starmer has spent his first six months in power laying the groundwork for a better relationship with Brussels, with the UK hoping for better defence cooperation and smoother trade, and the EU seeking a mobility scheme allowing for greater travel by young people in return. Cooperation between the UK and the rest of Europe has recently intensified after the return to power of Donald Trump in the US, with European leaders agreeing to higher military spending to counter the threat of Russia in a world where they will have to rely less on US backing. After a meeting of EU leaders this week, Starmer spoke on Friday to António Costa, the president of the European Council, and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, along with the leaders of Canada, Turkey, Norway and Iceland about how to bolster the continents defences. The prime minister has also been working closely with Frances Emmanuel Macron and others as they seek to persuade Trump not to turn his back entirely on Ukraine. While Starmer has insisted the UK does not have to choose between closer ties with the EU and with the US, and he has no intention of reversing Brexit, his government appears to be moving far closer to European neighbours than under the Conservatives. The TUC was a key player in the remain campaign in the 2016 referendum, though some general secretaries and a large minority of union members were Eurosceptics. In a joint statement, the TUC and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) will call on political leaders in London and Brussels to renegotiate the 2020 trade and cooperation agreement, describing it as botched under the Conservatives. They will say any new deal should support opportunities for workers in Europe and the UK, reduce trade barriers and border checks and bring closer alignment of chemical and food standards. The TUC has recently undertaken a number of polling and focus group exercises to understand developing views on Brexit among union members, led by Peter McLeod, a pollster who has worked for Labour. In six focus groups with Conservative-Labour switchers and Labour voters interested in Reform, the majority said they were interested in renegotiatin...",Politics,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/07/britains-biggest-unions-call-for-much-closer-uk-eu-ties-amid-volatile-global-economy,2025-03-08
Divided Reform UK reports own MP to police amid bullying claims,"Party chair and chief whip issue statement alleging female employees complained about Rupert Lowe Reform UK has erupted into open civil war after the party said its MP Rupert Lowe had received complaints about bullying and had made threats against the party chair, a day after Lowe criticised Nigel Farage for being messianic. Lowe responded with anger, saying there was no evidence to back up the bullying claims, and that it was entirely untrue that he had made threats. He again criticised Farage, saying Reform was our party as much as it is Nigels. He also explicitly linked the allegations to his decision to criticise Farage, saying that the day after he had done this, he had received a knife in my back over false allegations. In a joint statement by the chair, Zia Yusuf, and Reforms chief whip, Lee Anderson, they said they were obligated to disclose that the party received complaints from two female employees about serious bullying in Lowes offices. One of the complainants worked in Lowes parliamentary office and the other in his Great Yarmouth constituency office, they said, adding: We understand complaints have been made to parliamentary authorities. The statement said: Evidence was provided to us of workplace bullying, the targeting of female staff who raised concerns, and evidence of derogatory and discriminatory remarks made about women, including reference to a perceived disability. We feel we have a duty of care to all our staff, whether employed directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we appointed an independent kings counsel to conduct an investigation into the veracity of these complaints. To date, Mr Lowe has yet to cooperate with this investigation. In addition to these allegations of a disturbing pattern of behaviour, Mr Lowe has on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence against our party chairman. Accordingly, this matter is with the police. A Reform spokesperson said Lowe had lost the party whip in parliament. In a reply sent to the Guardian and posted on X, Lowe said he was disappointed, but not surprised at the statement, and that he had fully cooperated with the KC, saying she was shocked at what had happened. He said: Allegations of physical threats are outrageous and entirely untrue. I have never made any derogatory comments about women, or those with disabilities. This is a lie. These allegations are not even referring to me. I will be seeking legal advice immediately. There is no credible evidence against me, as the KC has stated on numerous occasions.

‘Don’t punish the vulnerable’: Labour MPs uneasy over planned welfare cuts,"Ministers say unsustainable rise in spending must be tackled but many backbenchers fear changes will not work Dozens of backbench Labour MPs are unhappy with plans to cut billions from the rising welfare bill, with ministers holding meetings to convince them that the changes to disability benefits are necessary. Labour MPs told the Guardian there were deep concerns within the parliamentary party that the changes would take money from the poorest, which was not what they had entered government to do. No 10 is preparing to make the case for welfare cuts before Rachel Reevess spring statement, with Keir Starmers spokesperson saying on Friday that there had been an unsustainable rise in welfare spending. Our broken social security system is holding our people back, our economy back, he said. Weve got 3 million people out of work for health reasons, one in eight young people are not currently in work, education or training, and that is a shocking situation to be in. He added: Left as it is, the system weve inherited would continue to leave more and more people trapped in a life of unemployment and inactivity, and thats not just bad for the economy, its bad for those people too, and its why this government is going to set up plans to overhaul the health and disability benefits system in the coming weeks. No 10 said the prime minister was in agreement with Reeves, who told Sky the welfare system was letting down taxpayers because it cost too much. We dont need an Office for Budget Responsibility forecast to tell us that weve got to reform our welfare system, the chancellor said. The government is trying to separate the arguments about changes to the welfare system from Reevess need to find savings and balance the books, with proposals expected before the spring statement. Given the governments large majority, there is little chance of it failing to push through its planned changes to the disability benefit system, but some Labour MPs said they would nevertheless struggle to vote for any measures that take money away from the poorest in society. Labour MPs said they had met ministers in small groups about the proposals for welfare changes and some have also written to the Department for Work and Pensions expressing concerns. One senior Labour MP said there had not been enough effort to work on the reasons for higher disability benefit payments, from poor mental health provision and long waiting lists to declining health and life expectancy in many parts of the country. We are a rich country but we have lots of poorer people. Do not target stuff at the poorest and most vulnerable. There are others ways of doing it, the MP said. There are lots of backbenchers concerned about this  its unhelpful in terms of how this has been trailed in the media and I feel that its too politically slanted as well. You cant outflank the right. Another Labour MP, Rachael Maskell, a former shadow cabinet minister, told the Guardian many colleagues were feeling really nervous a...",Politics,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/07/dont-punish-the-vulnerable-labour-mp-uneasy-over-planned-welfare-cuts,2025-03-08
UK Treasury ‘weighs up funding cuts at GB Energy’ in blow to Ed Miliband,"Government considering such a move over state-owned firm set up by Labour in Junes spending review, say reports The UK government is reportedly weighing up the possibility of cutting planned funding for GB Energy, the state-owned company set up by Labour to drive renewable energy and cut household bills, in Junes spending review. Cuts to the 8.3bn of taxpayer money promised over the five-year parliament would be another blow for Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, after he was overruled by the government when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backed the expansion of Heathrows third runway. GB Energy, a vital cog in Keir Starmers plans to supercharge Britains clean energy revolution, was only given an initial 100m in Octobers budget to cover its first two years. Ministers are carrying out a zero-based review of all government spending, which has been given additional impetus after Starmers pledge to boost investment in defence. One option under consideration by the Treasury is to cut 3.3bn earmarked for GB Energy to fund low-interest loans via local authorities, for projects such as solar panels and shared-ownership wind projects, according to the Financial Times. A Treasury spokesperson said: We are fully committed to the 8.3bn for GB Energy, which is at the heart of our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower and to ensure our homes are cheaper and cleaner to run. Sources played down the likelihood of the government significantly defunding an initiative that formed an important plank of Labours energy strategy. One source suggested that the government might maintain the promised level of funding but rebadge the budgets of other green initiatives to become part of GB Energy, effectively allowing departmental cuts in other areas. The speculation will, however, reignite rumours of a power battle within Labour ranks, pitched between No 10, the Treasury and Milibands net zero department. Last year, before Labours election victory, Starmer cut its green investment plan from 28bn a year to under 15bn, in a blow to Miliband. Sources close to the government said the Treasury was now running the rule over everything before the spring statement this month, which is expected to show that Reevess headroom against her fiscal rules has been wiped out. Another source warned of a rerun of the febrile months before the autumn budget, when swirling speculation hit business confidence and investment. GB Energy has the potential to be a real confidence booster to business. Scaling it back would damage investor sentiment and, frankly, be electoral madness. Its hugely popular on the doorstep, especially in Scotland, they said. Last month, GB Energy admitted that it could take 20 years to meet its pledge to employ 1,000 people, as the chair, Jürgen Maier, refused to put a date on when it would bring down energy bills.

"Tory peer introduced PPE firm to government after Cameron text, Covid inquiry hears","Inquiry looks at contracts worth 50m awarded to company linked to Lord Chadlington after he emailed DHSC adviser A Conservative peer introduced a company he was involved in to the government to supply PPE after he first contacted David Cameron by text message, the Covid-19 public inquiry has heard. The inquiry is hearing evidence this week about the governments multibillion-pound spending on medical supplies during the crisis, including its use of the VIP lane, which gave high priority to companies with political connections and awarded them 3.8bn PPE contracts. The inquiry is considering two contracts worth 50m awarded to SG Recruitment to illustrate how the VIP lane worked. The first contract was awarded just one week after the Tory peer, Peter Gummer, whose peerage title is Lord Chadlington, approached Cameron. Chadlington was the chair and a shareholder in the parent company, Sumner Group Holdings (SGH), registered in Jersey. Emails and messages published by the inquiry in a written submission showed that Cameron gave Chadlington the phone number for another Tory peer, Andrew Feldman, a close friend of the former prime ministers, who was advising the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on PPE procurement. On the same day Chadlington texted Feldman, writing: Andrew. I work with company with PPE. D says you are helping. Shall I put you in touch? Peter. Feldman replied positively, and gave Chadlington his new DHSC email address. Chadlington then sent an email introducing Feldman to David Sumner, the majority shareholder and chief executive of SGH, which was disclosed to the Guardian in response to a freedom of information request. David, Chadlington wrote, addressing Sumner, copying them both in. This is my friend Andrew Feldman. He can help you with PPE we discussed this morning. Drop me off chain. Peter. Sumner followed up by writing to Feldman offering to supply PPE, which Feldman forwarded to civil servants operating the VIP lane. Feldman told them it was: An interesting offer from David Sumner, who was introduced to me by Lord Chadlington. The emails published this week by the Covid inquiry show that Sumner updated Chadlington, who replied with encouragement, telling Sumner on 21 April 2020: Excellent. Looks like you have an inside track. Good luck. On 26 April 2020, Chadlington wrote to Sumner: I should  talk to DC David Cameron and to Feldman  theyve been batting for us on this and I want to say thanks for support. A week after Chadlingtons first approach to Cameron, the DHSC awarded SG Recruitment a contract for 23.9m, to supply coveralls. Then on 28 May 2020, the company was awarded a second contract, for 26.1m, to supply hand sanitiser. When the second contract was signed, Sumner sent a WhatsApp message to Chadlington, saying: Hand sanitizer contract in and signed! 135m of revenue under contract from DHSC for the two contracts! Chadlington replied saying: Great news, and indicated this would boost the companys share price.

The minister ridiculed the partys deputy leader Richard Tice, who on Thursday appeared not to know the names of two council defectors during a visit to Glasgow. Under questioning from journalists, Tice appeared to have forgotten or not known the surnames of councillors James Gray and Ross Lambie, who had left the Tories to join his party, only using their first names. Earlier in the day the deputy of the Nigel Farage-led party said both Scottish Labour and the SNP were terrified of them. Speaking to the PA news agency after a speech in Edinburgh, Murray said: Were certainly not terrified of a party (whose deputy leader) doesnt know the name of his own councillors. He added that Labour has to perform as a government to succeed in next years Holyrood election. Weve set out our stall, weve set out our missions, Murray added.

Dramatic fall in London’s levels of deadly pollutants after Ulez expansion,"People in capital breathing much cleaner air, with significant improvements in capitals most deprived areas People in London have been breathing significantly cleaner air since the expansion of the ultra low emission zone (Ulez), a study has found. Levels of deadly pollutants that are linked to a wide range of health problems  from cancer to impaired lung development, heart attacks to premature births  have dropped, with some of the biggest improvements coming in the capitals most deprived areas. Sadiq Khan had faced severe opposition to the 2023 expansion of Ulez to outer London boroughs. But on Friday as the report was published, the mayor of London said the scheme had driven down pollution, taken old polluting cars off the roads and brought cleaner air to millions more people. He said: When I was first elected, evidence showed it would take 193 years to bring Londons air pollution within legal limits if the current efforts continued. However, due to our transformative policies we are now close to achieving it this year. Several outer London councils mounted unsuccessful legal challenges to the Ulez rollout, and Keir Starmer blamed it for Labours defeat in the Ruislip and Uxbridge byelection and called for Khan to reflect on his plans. But Fridays report, published by the Greater London Authority with findings extensively reviewed by an independent advisory group of experts, said Ulez had had a positive impact and that Londons air quality had improved across the board and at a faster rate than that of the rest of the country. The report covers the first year since the zones expansion and is the fullest analysis of its impact yet conducted. Khan said: The decision to expand the Ulez was not something I took lightly, but this report shows it was the right one for the health of all Londoners. It has been crucial to protect the health of Londoners, support childrens lung growth and reduce the risk of people developing asthma, lung cancer and a host of other health issues related to air pollution. The report found Londons air quality was improving at a faster rate than that of the rest of England. It said this was particularly notable in outer London, where concentrations had improved more rapidly over recent years and were now similar to the average for the rest of England. Climate-heating gases have been substantially reduced, with carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to nearly 3m one-way passenger trips between Heathrow and New York saved. Maria Neira, the director of environment, climate change and health at the World Health Organization (WHO), praised Londons efforts, which she said would contribute to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. She said: Improving air quality through initiatives like Ulez is crucial for protecting public health and reducing the burden of disease. Cleaner air leads to healthier communities, lower rates of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, and a better quality of life for all residents.

"Ministers delaying inquiry into treatment of migrant carers, RCN says","Exclusive: Nursing union says it continues to receive complaints about low pay, unfit housing and illegal fees Ministers are dragging their heels on an investigation into the mistreatment of migrant carers, the countrys largest nursing union has said, as it continues to receive complaints about low pay, substandard accommodation and illegal fees. Nicola Ranger, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, has written to Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, to urge her to speed up her promised investigation into the abuse of foreign care workers. Despite the governments promises to clamp down on abusive practices by rogue employers and agencies, the RCN says it continues to receive more than 100 calls a year from nurses who say they are being mistreated. Ranger said in her letter: The RCN is deeply concerned by reports of exploitative workplace practices that many international educated nursing staff in the care sector face. Our members report a range of issues from long working hours, excessive repayment fees to exit contracts, substandard and crowded accommodation, and illegal work finding fees. Cooper promised last June to hold an investigation into the experiences of people coming to the UK to work in the social care sector, after the Guardian uncovered widespread allegations of mistreatment. The investigation showed how dozens of migrant nurses had been induced to pay tens of thousands of pounds for their visas on the promise of a job, only to find little or no work when they arrived. Some were sharing rooms, and even beds, with other migrant workers, to make ends meet. The problems stem from the decision by the previous government to relax the rules around sponsoring care worker visas, which ministers took in response to a staffing crisis in social care. Cooper said at the time the Guardians revelations were a disgrace, adding: There must be a full investigation into these reports to ensure standards are upheld, and exploitative employers are prosecuted. Since winning the election, Labour has indicated it will conduct this investigation through a new employment regulator which ministers are setting up as part of the employment rights bill. The government is yet to decide the exact remit for the new regulator, however, suggesting it will take several more months to establish. Ranger said in her letter: I am concerned that based on current timelines, the creation of the single enforcement body  subject to the passing of the employment rights bill  will not be until spring 2026 at the earliest. A subsequent investigation is likely to take several months to conclude.

"Migrants and refugee families in the UK denied childcare funding, report finds","Immigration status is denying children equal access to early years education and pushing families deeper into poverty Tens of thousands of children in migrant and refugee families in the UK are being denied access to government-funded childcare because of benefit restrictions linked to their parents immigration status, a report says. Having no recourse to public funds (NRPF) means parents are not entitled to 30 hours of free childcare and are having to stay home to look after their young children instead of working. This is pushing families into poverty and denying their children the benefits of the early years education available to their peers, the report finds. About 4 million people in the UK are affected by NRPF restrictions, according to the report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in conjunction with the human rights organisation Praxis, which works with migrants and refugees. They include about 71,000 families who would otherwise qualify for 30 hours of free childcare a week  provided they met the income threshold  were it not for NRPF restrictions, which ban access to the social security system. The report argues that the system of childcare entitlements excludes families facing greatest disadvantage, despite the governments manifesto commitment to break down barriers to opportunity for every child. Families affected by NRPF are entitled to a halved offer of 15 funded hours of care for their three- and four-year-olds, and some low-income families may be entitled to care for their two-year-olds, but they cannot access any other support with childcare costs, including the extended entitlement for working parents, and universal credit support with childcare costs and tax-free childcare. Shams Sarker came to London three years ago from Bangladesh under a skilled migrant work visa, but his two-year-old daughter  who was born in the UK  is not entitled to the same government-funded childcare as other children. As a result, he and his wife take it in turns to stay at home to look after her, reducing working hours and income. His daughter, meanwhile, loses out on the opportunity to mix and learn with other children in an early years setting. We dont get access to certain things and have to pay extra for healthcare, fine, said Sarker. But at least let children have equal rights. I expected the rules to be the same for all children. My baby is growing up and shes not getting the same benefit that any other baby born here will have. IPPR and Praxis surveyed 159 parents who had at least one child below school age and were affected by NRPF restrictions. They found 55 used some sort of childcare, compared with 72 of the general population.

"The Guardian view on fixing England’s local democracy: reforming structures is the means, not the end | Editorial","There is a danger of vital policy getting tangled in ambitious government plans that combine council restructuring with devolution No one designing a system for delivering public services in a modern democracy would come up with something that looks like English local government. The patchwork of overlapping structures has evolved through generations of gradual reform. It is poorly understood by voters. A majority routinely abstain in council elections. The government is simplifying the system, ending the duplication of functions between county and district councils. That restructuring project will be combined with a renewed push for devolution in England. Here, too, existing arrangements are inconsistent. Some cities and wider metropolitan areas have been organised into combined authorities with directly elected mayors, each with bespoke powers. Transport and housing policy, for example, might sit under a different tier of government in a different part of the country, depending on whether a devolution deal was done. Labours policy, overseen by Angela Rayners communities and local government department, is for all of England to be covered by the mayor-led combined authority system. Six regions are to be fast-tracked, with plans due soon. Local government reorganisation and the push for devolution are related projects that mostly complement each other. But there are tensions. Devolution deals must be ratified by local authorities, which means councillors who dont like one part of the proposed changes might, depending on the sequence of reform, wield a veto over another part of the plan. Central government policy could become a hostage in the transition. Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to build hundreds of thousands of new homes, to which end the government also proposes planning reform. But housing policy, as currently implemented, relies on the lower tier of local government, which is due for dissolution in many areas. The choreography of overlapping reforms is not simple. Shuffling the structures risks becoming the primary focus, consuming money and administrative capacity that are already in short supply at local and central government level. A proliferation of jurisdictional turf wars and partisan squabbles to define new roles could become a distraction from the task of delivering better public services, which is  or should be  one of the reforms benefits. A sound principle is driving the changes. British politics has been far too centralised for too long. A successful series of changes would create areas of jurisdiction that are big enough to be laboratories for policy innovation, benefiting from economies of scale, while being local enough that communities feel connected to their leaders, who can then be rewarded for success and held accountable for failure. The truly gamechanging move would be fiscal devolution, but the Treasury jealously guards control over tax-and-spend levers. Chancellors have always suspected, with justification, that the...",Politics,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-fixing-englands-local-democracy-reforming-structures-is-the-means-not-the-end,2025-03-08
Military spending is touted as a remedy for Britain’s ailing economy. Here’s why it won’t work | Khem Rogaly,"Since the 1980s Britains military spending has grown in real terms, yet more than half of military jobs have been lost. The sector is hi-tech and low labour Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have announced their latest rescue remedy for Britains economy. Old promises  good jobs, thriving small businesses and regional equality  will now be delivered by an increased military budget, used to buy equipment from the private sector. More military spending is not a tonic, however, but a poison that will worsen our economic ills and make Britain less safe in the long run. Assurances of prosperity for small businesses and ex-industrial towns rest on a misleading depiction of military spending. Last financial year, 56 of Ministry of Defence spending with UK businesses went to London and the south of England. In the same year, nearly 40 of the 37.6bn military equipment budget went to just 10 multinational companies. Slashing red tape and granting small businesses more access to the military budget will not build a family-run missile factory on every street corner of ex-industrial Britain. BAE Systems, leading weapons dealer to government and happy recipient of 15 of the equipment budget, has just declared record orders and rising profits. Military contractors are large multinationals that reward their asset manager shareholders from government contracts: since 2015, BAE has paid out 9.8bn to shareholders while receiving more than a fifth of its global revenue each year from the British government. While in a few specific areas, communities are reliant on jobs at military contractors, this is the result of public spending decisions, not the benevolence or dynamism of private companies. Although the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard now relies on contracts to build nuclear submarines, in the early 1960s its most profitable work was making engines for British Rail. Policy choices have left communities dependent on military contracts because of divestment from public services and civilian industry. Regardless, military spending is not a viable strategy for growth or the creation of good jobs nationally: Ministry of Defence spending on business directly supports 130,000 full-time jobs in the UK; if including supply chains, this rises to 209,000 or 0.83 of the workforce. Even with the military budget set to grow further over the next parliament, the industry it supports is too small to transform the nations economy. More important, the connection between military spending and job creation has weakened over time. Despite falling as a share of GDP, Britains military budget has grown in real terms since the early 1980s  the height of the cold war  yet at the same time more than half of jobs in the military industry have been lost. The military sector is increasingly a hi-tech employer that relies less on manufacturing and more on IT and engineering jobs in the south of England. Modelling in the US and continental Europe suggests that investment in public services, environment...",Politics,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/07/britain-military-spending-economy-jobs-green-energy-public-services,2025-03-08
"As the youngest peer in the House of Lords, I have a bold plan for this place. Abolish it – me included | Carmen Smith","I came here a year ago because Plaid Cymru seeks to protect Welsh interests. But I think Labour should keep its vow and scrap this chamber When I took my seat in the House of Lords almost a year ago, I pledged to campaign for the abolition of my job. Our second chamber has become a gated community of more than 800 members, making it the second largest legislative chamber in the world, topped only by Chinas National Peoples Congress. The House of Lords casts a shadow over parliament, and its unelected peers have a huge influence on the laws that get passed. Last March, I joined the second chamber representing Plaid Cymru. Aged 28, I was the youngest member of the chamber, and the youngest ever life peer. Plaid Cymru doesnt believe that an unelected chamber should form part of our democracy, but we do believe that we should have a seat at the table wherever decisions affecting Wales are being made. Since taking my seat in the Lords, I have been clear about my desire to change the system from within, while standing up for Welsh people and for young people across Britain. As much as I have enjoyed working with members across the political spectrum, over the past year I have gained a rare insight into how Westminster functions behind the scenes and, at times, how it fails to function altogether. One only need look at the recent Lords debate investigation in this newspaper to see the conflicts of interest that persist within the second chamber, where some peers have used their positions to advance commercial interests. With a large new intake of MPs, there is increasing momentum for change from within Westminster. The recent election resulted in the highest ever number of parliamentary newbies in the House of Commons  335 new MPs, including 20 under the age of 30, the highest number of MPs from ethnic minority backgrounds, and the lowest proportion of MPs who attended fee-paying secondary schools. Many have claimed this is the most diverse House of Commons in history. Yet while Keir Starmer vowed to abolish the Lords before he was elected and replace it with a democratically elected second chamber, his plans have since been scaled back to merely scrapping the 92 all-male hereditary peers. The resulting bill is a minimal reform. It falls far short of what was outlined in the Labour partys manifesto, and does nothing to stem the jobs-for-life handed out by prime ministers to their party donors and friends. The time is up for these outdated traditions and procedures. Thats why I have tabled several amendments to the hereditary peers bill, with the aim of strengthening it, pushing for the delivery of Labours manifesto commitments, and ultimately making the Lords into an elected chamber. People should be involved in the political decisions that affect their day-to-day lives, either directly, via citizens assemblies, or by electing representatives they trust to advocate on their behalf. Those decisions should not be taken and shaped by unelected peers, some ...",Politics,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/07/plaid-cymru-peer-carmen-smith-house-of-lords-unelected-chamber-labour,2025-03-08
"If Britain must rearm, how to pay for it? Stiffen the sinews; summon up the taxes | Polly Toynbee","It will fall to Rachel Reeves and the Treasury to fund the PMs crisis reset. I can help with that, as can John Maynard Keynes A new era is upon us. Ursula von der Leyen was not holding back. This is a world turned upside down, changed beyond recognition. Leaders across Europe are echoing the alarm sent out by the European Commission president, and rippling across the continent, Canada and elsewhere: that we face a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has seen in our adult lifetime. She has proposed a plan that would offer 800bn (660bn) for immediate rearming, with a European sky shield to protect Ukraine. The hooligan Russian asset in the White House has changed everything so profoundly that it is hard to keep track. The US, whose coat-tails we clung to, whose culture we revelled in, whose cleverness dazzled and stupidity confounded, is now the enemy. The shock feels viscerally personal because American culture is deep in our veins at all ages, from Sesame Street to Marvel, from Philip Roth to Philip Glass, the Oscars to Silicon Valley, like it or not. In Iraq and Afghanistan, we obediently followed their blunders, and 642 British soldiers died, as Keir Starmer adroitly reminded JD Vance in parliament. Our glamorous friend has turned fiend. How do we cauterise that off us? Or reconfigure the map of the world in terms of friends and foes? Former UK ambassadors to Washington ruminated over this seismic shift, which has shaken every norm from their Foreign Office days. This is not a blip in the relationship, something fundamental is going on, one old knight warned a Lords select committee, while another cautioned that the US giving up on Europe in favour of Russia was likely a current reality. Sir David Manning pinpointed Britains specific anguish at this moment, the downside of the so-called special relationship: as Europe galvanises to rearm, unlike our continental neighbours, we depend on the US for our defence. With every new shock wave, Britain feels this trauma in its marrow. Yet there is hesitancy in government about addressing the nation with a call to arms, as French president Emmanuel Macron has done, warning: the innocence of these 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall is over. Look at the remarkable response of Germanys chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, lifetime financial conservative and fiscal dogmatist, as he grasps the severity of the times: he will reverse all his previous fiscal policies and his nations usual dread over borrowing, breaking their basic law with a huge 500bn loosening of debt rules to rearm. This amounts to one of the most historic paradigm shifts in German postwar history, according to Deutsche Bank. German borrowing costs shot up, but so have predictions of German growth from a sluggish 0.8 to 2, with investors sending industrial stocks soaring. But note this: in his fiscal sea change, rearming will not be accompanied by any cuts to German social spending. How about Britain?

Trump respite lets out-of-kilter Starmer get back to the day job | John Crace,"After so much time spent on global diplomacy, a hi-vis Keir found he didnt quite know how to do normal any more What just happened? It was quiet. Much too quiet. Outside his bedroom window, he could have sworn he heard birdsong. Keir Starmer opened one eye. Cautiously. With an air of trepidation. Then, almost reluctantly, he opened the other. He leaned over to his bedside table and reached for his phone to see what fresh hell awaited him. What disasters the orange manchild in the White House had inflicted on the rest of the world while he had been asleep. It had reached the point where he had come to confuse the daily reality check with his darkest nightmares. Nothing. Well, almost nothing. Just one late-night post on Donald Trumps social media feed warning the people of Gaza that they would all die if they didnt release the Israeli hostages. Keir exhaled. That was someone elses problem. The Middle East was well above his pay grade. Others could take the lead in brokering a peace there. All that was required of him was to say a few tough words condemning Hamas and calling for a two-state solution from time to time. Nothing also from JD Vance since he had declared that the UK and French armed forces were basically a waste of space. Sure, the vice-president had gone on to say he definitely hadnt aimed his remarks at the French and the British, even though we all knew that was exactly what he had meant. That had left everyone playing diplomatic cover-up because no one could afford to openly embarrass the Americans. The new world order meant sucking up to the bullyboys. There was no way around that. The alternative was a possible escalation in the war with Ukraine. It just didnt help when the two most powerful men in the US were dim and dangerous. For the last few weeks or so, Starmer felt he had been playing catch-up. Waking up each day to find himself firefighting the latest White House efforts to encourage the Russians to escalate the war in Europe. And every time he had felt he just might be getting ahead of the curve, The Donald and his obsequious sidekick had gone out of their way to make things worse. Hold their beer. But today was a pleasant respite. Almost a return to the normal workings of prime ministerial life. Not exactly a return to the quotidian but as close as it was likely to get in the foreseeable future. He just needed to work out how to square his promise to the Americans not to share military intelligence with Ukraine with his commitment to Volodymyr Zelenskyy to continue to do so. Perhaps it didnt count if he did it with his eyes shut. Or if he told someone else who would then tell the Ukrainian president. To his surprise, Keir found he didnt quite know how to do normal any more. So much of his time had been spent on global diplomacy, AKA wrangling the incontinent toddler in the White House and leading the European response, that he had rather forgotten how to do the day job.

"British defence jobs and skills will keep us safe, says the PM. So he’d better buy the UK’s jet, not the US one","Why purchase American-made F-35 jets instead of upgraded T5 Typhoons? Surely that would make a mockery of all he promised In his statement to parliament last week, Keir Starmer pledged 13.4bn more spending on defence from 2027, rising to 3 of GDP in the next parliament. This additional spending is critical for our future defence. The House of Lords defence committee has pointed out that decades of underinvestment have hollowed out our defences, and that our vulnerabilities, especially in air defences, could put the UK in peril. The prime minister also promised that the government will translate defence spending into British growth, British jobs, British skills and British innovation. Our 70,000 Unite members working in UK defence companies will certainly hold him to it. The first test of this brave new world will be how we replace our ageing RAF fighter jets. The RAF has 24 T1 Eurofighter Typhoons that need to be replaced. The obvious thing to do is purchase two new squadrons of the upgraded T5 Typhoons. All the UKs other partner nations in the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium  Germany, Italy and Spain  have recently made similar decisions. But it seems the UK is going in another direction, perhaps purchasing American-made F-35 jets. The Royal Navy already uses F-35s on its aircraft carriers. Unite is not proposing to change that. But replacing British RAF Typhoons with American F-35s would make a mockery of the prime ministers promise on British jobs and British skills. Unite research has determined that a UK order of 24 F-35s would only secure two or three months of work in the UK, for about 2,000 workers. An order for 24 Typhoons would secure more than 20,000 jobs for years for workers in BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo and the UK supply chain. The skills issue is, if anything, even more concerning. Right now, the UK can develop, deploy and control our own fighter jets. And we are part of a vital programme to continue that capacity into the future. The global combat air programme (GCAP) will allow the UK to produce the next generation of fast fighters, beyond Typhoons, known in the UK as Tempest, along with our partners Italy and Japan. As the House of Commons defence committee recently warned: Retention of the existing Typhoon manufacturing workforce  until full-scale production of Tempest is under way, must be a priority. Tempest is planned to enter service in 2035. If we dont get more Typhoons to assemble in the UK in the interim, it will be too late. The UK is one of the few countries in the world with the capacity, at BAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, to do final assembly on the most modern fighter jets. At Rolls-Royce we also have the highly specialist capacity to manufacture and maintain what the Americans call afterburners for military jet engines. To retain these critical skills, and the vital military capability that follows from that, we desperately need a new order of Typhoons. If that doesnt happen, these skills, these jobs and ...",Politics,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/06/british-defence-jobs-uk-jet-american-f35-typhoon,2025-03-08
Britain is now following a developing country economic model – and we know where that leads | Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah,"Selling off assets to foreign owners, deregulating markets, and liberalising financial services only leads to inequality and instability In 1994, I joined a march protesting against how the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  backed by the US  were forcing governments in the global south to follow what was called the Washington consensus. We argued that privatising state assets, deregulating markets, and liberalising financial services to attract external investment was leaving countries more unstable, more unequal and more dependent on foreign actors. Decades on, I am horrified that an approach that wreaked havoc in the global south is still being pursued in the UK. Britain was of course the trailblazer for privatising infrastructure in the Thatcher years, and subsequent UK governments went on to use public-private partnerships to fund new schools, hospitals, roads and prisons, with much of the capital being raised overseas. While many countries in the global south have been coerced into selling off their assets, successive UK governments have done so enthusiastically, watering down our regulations and lowering tax barriers  known as de-risking in todays parlance  to attract foreign entities seeking to buy up British assets. And buy up they have. According to the latest count by the Office for National Statistics, 38 of all turnover of non-financial businesses in Britain went through foreign owned companies. US businesses have been the primary beneficiaries of Britains mass sell-off of its assets, with the value of (known) holdings domiciled in the US rising from 242bn to 708bn in the decade to 2023 (likely to be far greater if we knew how much they also have of the 630bn or so of further holdings being routed through low-tax regimes like Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UKs own crown dependencies). I dont think even Thatcher would have imagined that a quarter of British GDP would today be made up of sales of US multinationals like Amazon, Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs and Uber. What that means is that key decisions are being made elsewhere, intellectual property is often held overseas, profits are extracted and taxes not paid here. As the economist Angus Hanton argues, the UK has become a vassal state, paying economic tribute to the American owners of its assets. Indeed, some have speculated that Donald Trump may spare the UK in his global trade tariff war because the UK has already removed most obstacles to US economic supremacy and wealth extraction. Having sold off our public assets, and hollowed out the states capacity to directly deliver services and infrastructure, we now rent our public services from the foreign entities that own our buses, water companies, energy networks, prisons, care homes, and provide us with the IT services needed to run the state. There is also a bitter irony that some of these foreign entities are actually state-owned enterprises.

Starmer is at his best right now – but he must accept there is no going back with Trump’s US | Martin Kettle,"The president has just four years until a successor takes the reins, but the new approach he has forged  exceptionalist, isolationist  is likely to endure Keir Starmer, it turns out, is at his best in a crisis. He has faced two since he became prime minister last year, one domestic, the other international. The first came with the riots that followed the Southport killings, when Starmers response was impressive and effective. The second is Donald Trumps attempt to stitch up Ukraine, where Starmer has been surefooted in trying to hold the line against a sellout to Russia. In both cases, he has looked like the right person in the right place at the right time. There was another example of this deftness on Wednesday in the Commons, when Starmer went out of his way to mark the anniversaries of the deaths of UK service personnel in 2007 and 2012. A total of 642 died in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars alongside their US allies. They would not be forgotten, he said. The name of JD Vance was not mentioned. Nor was the US vice-presidents contemptuous some random country insult this week. But Starmers reprimand was unerring. It is far too soon to say whether Starmers response to Trumps embrace of Russia and to the US administrations denunciations of Europe will be effective in the long run. What can be said is that, in public and private, the prime minister has so far led with tact and clarity and has scored one or two apparent successes against the run of play. Nevertheless, these are very early days. Trump boasted to Congress on Tuesday night that he was just getting started. Starmers ability in a crisis is an unexpected contrast with his leadership in the ordinary business of politics. Since July 2024, Starmers calm, methodical, long-game approach has succeeded only in squandering much of Labours election-winning goodwill, and in making him seem out of his political depth. But his deployment of these same unflashy tactics at moments of acute crisis, as in the case of Ukraine, could be gold dust. It has at least given the prime ministers ratings a boost. There are echoes here of the rallying around Boris Johnson at the start of Covid. But remember where that ended up. It is useful to note that this low-key approach marks a notable break. Throughout the postwar period, British leaders faced with international crisis modelled themselves on Winston Churchill in 1940. Margaret Thatcher saw herself this way during the Falklands war. Tony Blair echoed it after 911 and over Iraq. Johnson pretended he was Churchill when Russia invaded Ukraine. Starmers calm approach evokes Clement Attlee more than Churchill. In every way he is unTrump. Yet Starmer has not got much to be calm about. The world of 2024 no longer exists. Trump has triggered a crisis in the North Atlantic alliance. At stake are two epochal things. First, whether Russias main western border will henceforward be with Ukraine, with Poland or with Germany.

‘Trump said he’d have our backs’: Starmer’s magical assertions comfort Badenoch | Zoe Williams,"The government and opposition seem to have parked their rancour like divorcees at a parents evening Prime ministers question time existed, on this ordinary-looking spring day, to answer one monumental question that nobody in the chamber had even asked: are we, as the unsettlingly thuggish US vice-president, JD Vance, has said, some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years? Keir Starmers opening statement, in which he soberly read out the names and ages of men who fought for their country, for our country, crescendoing: Across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 642 individuals died fighting for Britain alongside our allies, was arguably his direct and quite lawyerly response. We may be random, chum, but weve definitely fought in a bunch of wars, which  wait, let me check my notes  you started. Kemi Badenochs approach needs a bit of background. Shed been asked about our randomness by a reporter the day before, when she was on the farmers march, with Victoria Atkins standing behind her puzzlingly dressed in a union flag jacket, like Geri Halliwell trying to get into a golf club. Put a pin in that, because it will come up again later. Well, I know JD Vance quite well, Badenoch said. Ive looked at the comments, I dont think he actually said that. A lot of people are getting carried away, theyre saying loads of things. The unfortunate thing is, he did say that; if you wanted to deny it, your best possible bet would be he didnt mean us, he meant France, which wouldnt be very comradely. The opposition leaders course, to deny a thing we saw and heard, then cover it in the meaningless mouth-noises of a lot of people saying loads of things, looks like dimwittery but is actually systematically corroding observable reality. But never mind, in the Commons she took a new tack: a series of statements with which no reasonable person could disagree. She joined the prime minister in gratitude for our troops, and asked him to join her in hoping we wouldnt end up in a war against Russia. Thats the last thing anybody wants to see, Starmer agreed, and I dont want to say its the weirdest exchange thats ever happened in PMQs, but its certainly a new way to use time, agreeing that nobody wants that thing nobody wants. The surest risk is if Putin feels that he can breach a deal, Starmer continued, as if he was just one big thought away from the killer clause, that he could insert into a deal and make it watertight, and this satisfied Badenoch, who went on to be satisfied by a bunch of other optimistic, bordering on magical, assertions. Could the prime minister update the house on the steps he is taking to persuade America its in their national interest to provide a security guarantee? Sure he can: Trump already made it absolutely clear, in Washington, that he would have our backs, and Starmer has spoken to him three times since on the phone.

‘Nigel Farage feels real’: why young British men are drawn to Reform,"Once, anti-establishment youth disillusioned with mainstream politics headed left. Now increasing numbers are tilting right. Why? Josh is 24 years old and works as a carer. Its not easy work, but he prefers it to his old job in a supermarket: most of his clients are elderly and just want someone there with them, because theyre lonely. In his spare time Josh used to be into boxing. But lately hes got into politics instead. Like many of his gen Z contemporaries, hes thoroughly disillusioned with the mainstream kind. The two parties that have been in power for 100-plus years have done nothing. The economys a mess, he scoffs. But if he sounds like the kind of anti-establishment young person who once rallied to the radical left, Joshs frustration has taken him in another direction. An ardent leaver in his teens, who backed Boris Johnson in 2019, he now belongs to Nigel Farages Reform UK. We meet in the packed bar of the Athena theatre in Leicester, alongside about 900 people who have paid 15 and dodged a noisy counterprotest to see their hero in the flesh at Reforms East Midlands rally. Their reward is nearly three hours of speakers attacking small boat crossings, woke ideology and grooming gangs raping and trafficking young girls. If you dont want to respect our history, our heritage, our way of life, our laws, then clear off, barks Reform MP Lee Anderson, as burly men ferry pints from the bar. Andrea Jenkyns, the ex-Tory MP who defected to Reform, says her seven-year-old wants to join, and implores parents to sign their adult children up. Throughout the night, someone keeps heckling Listen to Tommy Robinson! (the jailed far-right thug Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, whom Farage has consistently frozen out). Speeches are high on energy and emotion, switching in tone from end-of-the-pier-show jokes to rabble-rousing: by the time Farage himself begins glad-handing his way through the crowd, the adrenaline is pumping. Pyrotechnics explode at his feet and the bass is turned up chest-poundingly high. Like Donald Trump, hes learned to dish up politics as entertainment. What attracted Josh, he explains, is that Reform have never been in power, so they havent been tried and seen to fail. But he also thinks theyre the only party standing up for British values, criticising what he sees as mainstream parties attitude to British history and tradition. He didnt go to university, but seems suspicious of what might have happened there: There need to be more safeguards to stop lecturers from putting their own worldview on to students. Josh is articulate, polite and unusually formally dressed for his age, in suit and tie: hes interested in becoming an MP. But hes perhaps less confident than he sounds. Im quite an introverted person, he concedes. When I ask what his friends think about Reform, Josh says hes hovered around a few friendship circles lately.

The Ukraine crisis has accelerated a reset of UK-EU relations – but will it last?,"Trumps abandonment of Ukraine has led even Farage to praise Starmers lead role in European diplomacy Barely a day passes, it seems, without Keir Starmer talking to another European leader or preparing for a continental summit. The crisis over Ukraine has very much pushed the UK closer towards the centre stage than at any point since Brexit. But is this a new era or a false dawn? One thing is certain: the optics of engagement have changed. Starmer never shared Boris Johnsons almost active pride in stoking a row with Brussels, but particularly before the election his advisers were wary of reminding voters about his past as a diehard remainer. With support for Ukraine about as close as the UK gets to an all-party consensus, things are very different. Starmer can be photographed at the very centre of a gathering of mainly European leaders, as he was on Sunday, safe in the knowledge that even Nigel Farage will praise him for his diplomacy. Donald Trumps apparent abandonment of Ukraine and reversal away from decades of Nato defence guarantees has really accelerated the rapprochement between Britain and Europe, not just the EU, said Peter Ricketts, the former senior UK diplomat and government national security adviser, who is now a crossbench peer. All the reports Ive heard from European friends in Brussels and Paris and elsewhere are that they are impressed and pleased with the Sunday meeting, and the sense that Britain is back in its natural place as a leader in European security, he said. It has taken the crisis, in a way, to really galvanise the improving relations that were already under way. This is happening amid what could be seen as a wider political shift. Polls about Brexit increasingly show that many voters view it as a mistake, and while there is arguably minimal appetite to revisit an issue that crippled UK politics for several years, trade unions are now pushing for closer EU ties. So could the necessities of supporting Ukraine help smooth the way for a close EU-UK relationship on trade? Lord Ricketts said he would be surprised if any of these Brussels red lines were suddenly blurred. I would draw a distinction between defence issues and the treaty-based issues about trade, fishing and energy markets and so on, which are all rooted in EU texts or EU-UK legal texts, which are going to be slower to change, he said. I think even with a crisis in Europe, in those sorts of areas its going to be slow going. Ukraine is to an extent a distinct issue. Defence links are often separated from Brussels, while the still-emerging coalition of the willing to fill the security vacuum covers some non-EU European states such as Norway, as well as Canada and potentially Australia. The defence and foreign policy wonks were already comfortable with a closer relationship with the UK, said Ian Bond, another former UK diplomat, who is deputy director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. The problem is what happens in other parts.

"‘I have a pathological need to be right’: Ash Sarkar on culture wars, controversy and Corbyn’s lost legacy","Shes been described as divisive by the left and the Queen of woke by the right, but does the journalists new book really signal a change in her entire belief system? Youre not going to believe me when I say this: Im a conflict-averse person, says Ash Sarkar. Shes laughing as she says it. Even if I did believe her, a lot of people wouldnt. Over the past decade, Sarkar has built a reputation for bringing the fight, robustly defending her positions, and generally putting herself in the line of fire  on television panel discussions, on social media and in her journalism (for this paper and as a contributing editor at Novara Media, among others). Even her detractors would admit shes very good at it, cutting through the politicians earnest bluster and articulating whats on ordinary peoples minds  none of which has endeared her to the rightwing. Now Sarkar has annoyed the leftwing as well. In her new book Minority Rule, she contends that embracing identity politics and culture wars has not always served the working class well. By making a virtue of marginalisation, breaking ourselves down into ever smaller and mutually hostile groupings, we make it impossible to build a mass movement capable of taking on extreme concentrations of wealth and power, she writes. Policing language and embracing concepts such as lived experience and white privilege has discouraged solidarity and alienated would-be allies. If she was looking to avoid conflict, this is a curious way to go about it. Such sentiments could be seen as throwing her allies under the bus and giving her opponents plenty of ammunition, hence the recent Daily Telegraph headline The Queen of woke just exposed the hypocrisy of the virtue-signalling left. The implication is that Sarkar adopted identity politics when it suited her in the past, but is now reversing her position. Sarkar doesnt see it like that. There are obviously things that Ive shifted on, she says when we meet. I definitely had that phase in my early 20s of being, like, she points around the room White privilege, white privilege, white privilege. You could point at a floor lamp and be like, Neo-colonial ideology. In part thats to do with being an arts and humanities graduate, where you are trained to look at everything as language and narrative and discourse  but this idea that I was somebody who was advancing a narrative around hypersensitivity and saying its a good thing, I dont think really fits the facts. What she is arguing for is less a 180-degree pivot than a return to first principles. I see it as a way to reflect on the last 15-odd years and say: What happens if I try to look at this through a rigorously materialist lens? So that doesnt mean throwing away anti-racism or pretending that everybody has the same experience of society but looking at the economic forces in society, the way in which politics is mediated through institutions of legacy media, social media, and saying: Where does that get me?

"American severance may be averted, but Europe’s leaders must fear the worst","Head-spinning speed of events leaves EU adapting at pace while trying to infer Trumps possible geo-strategic aims With a mixture of regret, laced with incredulity, European leaders gathered in Brussels to marshal their forces for a power struggle not with Russia, but with the US. Even now, of course at the 11th hour, most of Europe hopes this coming battle of wills can be averted and the Trump administration can still be persuaded that forcing Ukraine to the negotiating table, disarmed and blinded, will not be the USs long-term strategic interest. It has fallen to John Healey, the UK defence secretary; and Tony Radakin, the chief of the defence staff, meeting their opposite numbers in Washington to see if there are any conditions in which the US will provide the backstop Europe insists it needs to send a reassurance force into Ukraine to protect a ceasefire. One European diplomat said: We will know very soon if the US has set its face against helping Europe, and what its explanation is. As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, put it in his patriotic address on Wednesday night: I want to believe that the United States will remain at our side. But we must be ready if that is not the case. In saying this, he caught the spirit of the Brussels summit, and the new mood in Germany being led by the chancellor-elect, Friedrich Merz. It is, so far as relations with Washington are concerned, a mood of optimism of the will combined with pessimism of the intellect. It requires Europe to prepare for a severance with the US, and one that may come much sooner than Nato planners had envisaged. Specifically, it requires European nations to upend their economies and throw out their fiscal debt rules that once seemed immutable, even if it risks a confrontation with the bond markets as well as part of their electorates. Whatever it takes, the slogan coined by Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, to get Europe through the eurozone crisis, is being revived to get Europe through this security crisis. But in a sense, diplomats say, as with the eurozone crisis this is not just about money, or even transferring resources to spend more on defence over the next four years, critical as this will be. This is about political will, and taking the mental leap of independence from America. One western diplomat said: Macron was probably right in his talk of European strategic autonomy. We have wasted seven years not building a European defence capability, and now we must make up for lost time. The first stage is to put Donald Trump on the back foot by showing that Ukraine is not the war party, as claimed by the US vice-president, JD Vance. Kyivs proposal for an immediate pause in the fighting covering sea, air and energy installations is backed by Macron and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer. The aim is to flush Vladimir Putin out and try to show the White House that the obstruction to a ceasefire and a just deal lies in Moscow and not Ukraine.

Tesco trials giant trolley scales in Gateshead,"Giant trolley scales are being trialled at a Tesco store in Gateshead sparking a mixed reaction from shoppers. Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice. But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. Am I at border control or Tesco? one Reddit user posted, while another joked No clubcard? Deported! Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment. Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end. Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items theyve scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley. Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying they are 10x more convenient and faster, many were more critical of their introduction. More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief, one said, while another wrote the point of all this is to save on staff. Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs. There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. Its supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed. He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts. This is supermarkets saying, we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft. Theyre forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers dont feel trusted or think theyre being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else. The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is out of control after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers 2bn. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23 to more than 492,000 over the same period. That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003. Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was definitely an element of trying to control loss but added lets not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental. A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43 had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found.

"Data, waves and wind to be counted in the economy","Wind and wave are set to be included in calculations of the size of countries economies for the first time, as part of changes approved at the United Nations. Assets like oilfields were already factored in under the rules - last updated in 2008. This update aims to capture areas that have grown since then, such as the cost of using up natural resources and the value of data. The changes come into force in 2030, and could mean an increase in estimates of the size of the UK economy making promises to spend a fixed share of the economy on defence or aid more expensive. The economic value of wind and waves can be estimated from the price of all the energy that can be generated from the turbines in a country. The update also treats data as an asset in its own right on top of the assets that house it like servers and cables. Governments use a common rule book for measuring the size of their economies and how they grow over time. These changes to the rule book are tweaks, rather than a rewrite, according to Prof Diane Coyle of the University of Cambridge. Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calls it an accounting change, rather than a real change. He explains: Wed be no better off in a material sense, and tax revenues would be no higher. But it could make economies look bigger, creating a possible future spending headache for the UK government. For example, Labour has committed to allocating fixed percentages of the size of the economy on defence and aid. If the new rules increase the estimated size of the economy by 2-3 in 2030, it might add 2bn to defence spending. That is a tiny share of the total government budget, but large compared with the cuts to overseas aid (6bn) that are currently funding extra defence spending or the headroom that the government has left to meet its self-imposed fiscal rules (10bn). The government spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will not be including the impact of these new rules on the government finances in their assessment of the government finances this March. This makes the new rules a possible future headache for the Chancellor rather than an immediate one.

Trump 'strongly considering' large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia,"US President Donald Trump has said he is strongly considering large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal with Ukraine is reached. Trump said he was contemplating the move because Russia is absolutely pounding Ukraine on the battlefield right now. Trumps comments marked a sharp change in tone. Since coming into office, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraines leader for not wanting peace with Russia. Hours later, however, the US president told reporters he was finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine, and repeated that he trusted Putin. Last Friday, Trump berated Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Days earlier, he had even called him a dictator and blamed Ukraine for starting the war which began on 24 February 2022 when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighbouring country. The public dressing-down was followed this week by Trump pausing all US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. It is not clear if this enabled Russias large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraines energy infrastructure on Thursday night. On Friday morning, Trump issued his threat of sanctions tariffs against Russia - apparently over the attack. They Russia are bombing the hell out of them Ukraine right now... and I put a statement out, a very strong statement cant do that, cant do that, Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. Asked if that was a result of the US pause in military co-operation with Ukraine, Trump said Putin was doing what anyone else would do. And he justified the US move by saying: I want to know they Ukraine want to settle and I dont know they want to settle. In Fridays post, Trump wrote: I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. He did not provide any details as to how such sanctions and tariffs against Russia may work. Moscow is already under the heaviest Western sanctions in its history, many of which target its oil exports and foreign currency reserves. It has been able to get around them to a large extent by selling discounted oil to India and China, while importing many of the goods it previously got from the West through countries like Kazakhstan. China is reported to be helping to sustain Russias war effort with large volumes of dual-use technology, which it denies. The White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia. So it is possible that Trumps threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed. The problem is, we simply do not know what was discussed and what was agreed in that lengthy and highly productive 90-minute phone call that Donald Trump suddenly announced he had held last month with the Russian president.

Price of first-class stamp to rise to £1.70,"The cost of a first-class stamp will rise by 5p to 1.70 on 7 April, Royal Mail has announced. It will also raise the price of a second-class stamp by 2p to 87p on the same day. The company said the decision carefully considered balancing affordability with the increasing cost of delivering mail. Citizens Advice described the change as yet another blow to consumers, and said the change to the second class price was unjust. The number of letters Royal Mail delivers has fallen from a peak of 20 billion in 2004-05 to 6.6 billion last year. However, the price of stamps has continued to rise. Since 2022, Royal Mail has already hiked the cost of a first-class stamp five times from 85p to 1.65. The next increase, in April, was the result - it said - of delivering fewer letters to more addresses. We always consider price changes very carefully but the cost of delivering mail continues to increase, said Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail. A complex and extensive network of trucks, planes and 85,000 posties is needed to ensure we can deliver across the country for just 87p. But consumer advocate Citizens Advice said millions of people would be forced to pay more while also suffering from postal delays. Its unjust for Royal Mail to raise the price of a second-class stamp, while the regulator Ofcom looks at reducing second-class deliveries to alternate weekdays, said Tom MacInnes, the charitys director of policy. As first-class stamps are becoming unaffordable, people could be forced by price pressures into choosing a slower service. In January, regulator Ofcom proposed that Royal Mail should only deliver second-class letters every other weekday and not on Saturdays to protect the future of the UKs postal industry. The one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO) means Royal Mail has to deliver post six days a week, from Monday to Saturday, and parcels on five from Monday to Friday. Ofcom has launched a consultation on the new proposals, which is open to the public until 10 April. A decision is expected in the summer. Royal Mails parent company is being sold to a business controlled by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky in a deal worth 3.6bn, after the Labour government approved the deal last year. The government will maintain a golden share which means Mr Kretinskys business will have to get approval for any changes to Royal Mails ownership, the location of its headquarters and its tax residency. Royal Mail must also adhere to the USO, which Mr Kretinsky has pledged he will do for as long as I am alive.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwygl9vj28do,2025-03-08
US job growth stable as government cuts start,"US President Donald Trumps cuts to the government workforce have started to hit, but overall hiring last month remained stable as growth in other sectors offset those losses. The Labor Department said federal employment dropped by 10,000 in February. Across the economy, employers added 151,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1, from 4 in January. The monthly report from the government is a closely-watched signal of economic health that was under particular scrutiny this month, amid rising concern about the economic disruption sparked by Trump administration policy changes. Analysts had been forecasting about 170,000 new jobs. The monthly gain in February was similar to the average monthly rise of 168,000 over the past year, the Labor Department said. Hiring was driven by healthcare and financial firms. The manufacturing sector also added about 10,000 jobs, gains that were highlighted by the Trump administration. Government hiring slowed sharply, while analysts cautioned that the report did not yet reflect the full extent of the cuts that the White House has announced. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the report felt reassuringly in line with expectations, showing payrolls growth only modestly weaker than in recent months. Yet, while the worst fears were not met, the report does confirm that the labour market is cooling, she warned. Furthermore, with no shortage of headwinds confronting the US economy, the softening trend is likely to persist and may potentially deepen given the toxic combination of federal government layoffs, public spending cuts, and tariff uncertainty related inertia. Even before Donald Trump took office as president, financial analysts had been surprised at the long-running streak of growth in the US labour market, which came despite pressure from price increases and high interest rates. In his first weeks, Trumps changes to US policy have added to pressures on the economy, generating widespread uncertainty. His changes include tariffs on Americas top three trade partners, some of which have since been reversed, and cuts to federal jobs and spending, efforts that are facing challenges in the courts. In remarks at the White House, Trump acknowledged that there could be some disturbance in the economy. But he said he thought reducing the size of government and moving forward with tariffs would unleash private sector growth. I think the labour markets going to be fantastic but its going to have high-paying manufacturing jobs as opposed to government jobs, he said, adding that he could not commit to policy certainty on trade. There will always be changes, he said. Polls indicate that the moves have the support of his base. But financial analysts have warned that they are contributing to worries in financial markets, hurting consumer sentiment and fuelling weakness across a range of other economic indicators.

Boots gets new US owner in multi-billion dollar deal,"The US owner of the Boots pharmacy chain is being taken over by a private equity firm in a 10bn (7.8bn) deal. The price being paid for Walgreens Boots Alliance is a fraction of what the company was worth a decade ago, reflecting its struggles with growing debt and shoppers going online for cheaper products. There have been reports that the Boots chain could be sold off separately by its new owner, US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Walgreens chief executive Tim Wentworth said the firm was navigating the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape. While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company, he added. George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBCs Today programme that Boots had been in and out of different ownership for some time and that its business model has struggled. People are buying more of those personal healthcare brands online than they are in the shop. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Savvy Marketing, said there would be a lot of interested parties if the Boots business was put up for sale. She said the company had turned itself around after going through a difficult period and it was an unbelievably trusted brand with a unique place in the UK psyche. There are now 1,900 Boots stores left in the UK after the pharmacy chain began closing shops in June 2023 as part of a shake up. Ms Shuttleworth said reports of a Boots sale would be difficult for staff. Any uncertainty over your ownership is going to make you quite concerned if you work for Boots. Boots has been contacted for comment. Sycamore Partners is paying 11.45 per share for Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is more than its shares are currently worth on the US stock market. Walgreens shares rose by nearly 6 in extended trading in New York. But the companys stock market value has fallen by around 80 over the past five years. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The Illinois-based Walgreens took a 45 stake in Boots in 2012. It bought the remainder of the firm two years later in a deal that valued Boots at around 9bn. Walgreens is also made up of its namesake US retail business, specialty pharmacy group Shields Health Solutions and healthcare provider VillageMD. In recent years, the company has faced mounting challenges as customers turned to cheaper rivals. In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale but later dropped these plans, saying potential buyers had been unable to raise enough funds. In October, it announced plans to shut 1,200 Walgreens stores in the US over the next three years under a cost-cutting programme.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq0p27z69o,2025-03-08
Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remain,"Theres one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed. All the while, the autonomous machines on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat. The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean. Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts. We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint, explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals. The firms system is 95 accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says. The robots arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses  they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance. Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however. Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology, says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF. Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. If youre not sure whats down there, then leave it alone, says John Childs at Lancaster University. Thats been the widespread position from science to date. Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe. In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later. Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies. Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019. Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition. Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact. No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.

"Post Office compensation offer after death is 'slap in the face', says widow","A widow whose husband was caught up in the Post Office Horizon scandal is calling for compensation payments for victims to be sped up after she received her husbands offer of redress days after he passed away. Terry Walters, 76, died in February after years of ill health. He was one of the former sub-postmasters who took the Post Office to court in the landmark case led by Sir Alan Bates, which helped expose the scandal. Despite submitting a claim for full financial redress more than a year ago, he died without receiving all the money he was owed. The government says it has doubled the amount of payments made to former sub-postmasters. Days after losing Terry, his widow Janet received a letter making an offer of compensation  far below the amount the couple had claimed. She describes the offer as a slap in the face and says it has prompted her to share their story publicly for the first time. Enough is enough, she said. Terry used his redundancy money to take over the Hockley Post Office in Stockport in 2005. But less than two years later, he was suspended for alleged shortfalls. He was never allowed back behind his counter again and his contract was terminated the following year for thousands of pounds of losses that didnt exist. He and Janet had to sell their home and have been living in rented accommodation ever since. To have a big institution such as the Post Office come along and accuse you of doing something  it was devastating, says Janet, and humiliating. Now, ahead of Terrys funeral, Janet has decided to share their story  and is urging the government to ensure quick payment to others who are still waiting for compensation. Weve lived on promises all this time, she adds. Seventeen years out of somebodys life is a long time. There are no official figures for how many victims have died before receiving full compensation but, according to The Times, the number had reached more than 250 by early 2024. Terry had received an interim payment, which Janet says helped them manage as his health declined. But she insists that Terry would have been over the moon had he lived to receive his full compensation. She believes that receiving the money in the years before Terrys health declined could have made a huge difference to their quality of life. We could have done the things we had wanted to do all these years, buy a proper home perhaps, treat ourselves to a nice holiday, go out and do things, she said. According to the most recent figures, in the scheme created to provide redress for those in the original Group Litigation Order (GLO), 227 of 492 eligible claimants are still waiting for full and final compensation. The government says 407 offers have been made of the 425 people who have so far made full claims. With so many others still waiting for their full compensation, Janet now says she is considering writing to King Charles. There must be someone in a high authority that can say, well, its time this was finished, she says, so people have a c...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ernpd0k22o,2025-03-08
'A pig in lipstick': Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve criticised,"President Donald Trumps decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers. He has signed an executive order creating what he calls a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will consist of other forms of digital currency. The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings. White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency, drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets. However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process. Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal governments existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. Thats worth 17.5bn (13.6bn) at todays prices. Speaking to reporters at the White House ahead of a special crypto summit on Friday, Sacks said that it was a real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer. What we want to do is make sure that with the remaining Bitcoin that we have, he added. Nonetheless, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, called Thursdays announcement a pig in lipstick in response to Sacks post on X. No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government, he said. Trumps executive order says that the Treasury and Commerce secretary will come up with strategies for acquiring more government Bitcoin, provided these are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers. That meant, Sacks told reporters, they are only allowed to buy more if it doesnt add to the deficit or the debt. Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a horrible precedent and makes no sense. Without a clear framework, we risk arbitrary asset selections, which would distort the markets and drive a loss of public trust, he suggested. Other analysts though have been more positive. This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globes reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence. Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House. It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it will not cost taxpayers a dime. It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress. The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset.

Trump expands exemptions from Canada and Mexico tariffs,"US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week. It is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from the USs two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets. On Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25 import levies just a day after they came into effect. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canadas finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a colourful conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump. The US president used profane language more than once during Wednesdays heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports. Trudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief. Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed, he said. Sheinbaum said she had had an excellent and respectful call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way. The carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North Americas free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term. Items that currently come into the US under the pacts rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25 to 10. A White House official said about 50 of US imports from Mexico and 62 from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order. The White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored reciprocal trade duties on countries around the world. The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence. The SP 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, ended down nearly 1.8 on Thursday. George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said the hokey cokey with Trumps tariffs has it made it nigh on impossible for firms to manage their production lines and is putting pressure on the US economy. Meanwhile, he said it is galvanising a response from Europe, especially Germany, so weve seen a more positive reaction to European markets. In signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market.

Home buyers race to beat stamp duty rise,"Home buyers are scrambling to complete purchases by the end of the month or face paying thousands of pounds extra in stamp duty. First-time buyers in particular could be hit when stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland change on 1 April. One couple said they felt like they were in a race, and our prize is 11,000. Lenders say a significant swathe of the country will be drawn into paying the tax, but the government says it is helping more people to buy their first home. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than 250,000 do not pay stamp duty land tax, but this will revert to 125,000 from 1 April. For most first-time buyers the threshold is currently 425,000, but this will fall back to 300,000 in April. The increases to the thresholds had been introduced during the September 2022 mini-Budget. Paul Gorton featured in the 2024 series of cult reality TV series The Traitors. The 37-year-old and his partner Kate Waldron now face another episode of high jeopardy to complete the purchase of their first home in time. Were on a knife edge, weve got weeks, otherwise its going to cost us a large chunk for no reason, Mr Gorton said. They are trying to buy a property in Congleton, Cheshire. Ms Waldron, 34, said it was a particularly stressful time because she only gave birth to baby Cooper three months ago. They already have two-year-old Charlie and a dog called Buddy. Were doing it all at once. Its an added stress with this deadline looming over us, she said. Missing that deadline would cost them 6,500, despite having put all their money into the deposit, and facing the prospect of regular bills and nursery fees. Karen Potter, an estate agent in Southport, has about 37 clients in the danger zone of missing the deadline. In a stressful arena anyway, weve got this panic where theres another source of strain and stress for them, she said. Property portal Rightmove has estimated that in England, some 25,000 first-time buyers and 74,000 home movers, in the buying process, would be unable to complete in time to beat the deadline. Mortgage brokers have reported buyers pulling out of deals because they could not move before the end of March. The proportion of areas in England in which the average first-time buyer home falls into the scope of stamp duty will rise from 8.4 to 32 on 1 April, according to analysis by the Skipton Group, which includes a building society and estate agency. Stamp duty has always been a more common issue for buyers in the south east of England, where house prices are higher. Some will face higher stamp duty bills owing to the changing thresholds, which include the first-time buyer relief being available only to those buying a property for less than 500,000, rather than less than 625,000. Jonah Kavanagh and Elle Van Petersen are hoping to buy their first home together in Guildford. They, and their sellers, are pulling out all the stops to get the move completed in time. Failure to do so would cost them 11,000 extra in stamp du...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm1wre28dzo,2025-03-08
"SpaceX rocket explodes, raining debris from sky for second time in a row","A SpaceX rocket exploded shortly after it was launched from Texas on Thursday, grounding flights and triggering warnings about falling spaceship debris. SpaceX confirmed the un-crewed ship had suffered a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent into space, and lost contact with the ground. The massive SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever created, spun out of control shortly after its launch. No injuries or damage have been reported but images from those in Caribbean Sea island nations show fiery debris raining from the sky. This was the eighth mission to test the rocket, and its second consecutive failure. The spaceship, which measures 123m (403ft) at takeoff, was meant to re-enter Earths orbit over the Indian Ocean after a one-hour flight. Its Super Heavy booster, which helps it leave the ground, did manage successfully to return to the launchpad. SpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said teams immediately started co-ordinating with safety officials for pre-planned contingency responses. The statement added that SpaceX would review data to better understand the root cause of the misfire and noted the explosion happened after the loss of several engines. As always, success comes from what we learn, and todays flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starships reliability. The statement says debris should have fallen within a pre-planned area and the rocket did not contain any toxic materials. The company also included an email and phone number for those who believe theyve found any remnants of the craft. Musk has yet to comment on Thursdays explosion. The accident briefly halted flights at several Florida airports, including in Miami and Orlando, over concerns about flaming debris. A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the flights in and out of airports were delayed due to a space launch incident. The incident follows a test in January, which saw a Starship rocket fail minutes after launching from SpaceXs Texas facility. The FAA also briefly closed airports two months ago, due to the same concerns about falling debris. After Januarys incident, the FAA grounded Starship launches and noted the incident had led to property damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. Unfortunately this happened last time too, so we have some practice at this now, SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot told reporters at the launch site on Thursday. This latest Starship launch was conducted before the FAA finished investigating Januarys explosion, according to US media reports. A statement issued from the government of the Turks and Caicos said they were in contact with US authorities and SpaceX and would continue to keep the public apprised as we work to ensure the safety and security of our Islands. Footage posted on X purported to show flaming rocket debris falling over the Caribbean Sea. In the Bahamas, people posted that they were seeking shelter in order to take cover from debris. Starship is the bi...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj92wgeyvzzo,2025-03-08
Poundland could be put up for sale as taxes rise,"Poundlands owner has said it is considering putting the chain up for sale after warning tax changes coming in April will put more pressure on the business. The discount chain has 825 UK stores but sales were down this January and February, its Polish owner Pepco Group said. A rise in employer National Insurance (NI) contributions announced in the Budget start in April and Pepco says these will add further pressure to Poundlands costs. A host of High Street brands have warned of shop closures, job losses and price rises as a result of rising costs, but a government spokesperson said the chancellor had taken measures to support business, including capping the rate of corporation tax. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has previously defended the NI increase as the right decisions in the national interest. Pepco Group said Poundland was operating in an increasingly challenging UK retail landscape that is only intensifying. From April 2025, the UK governments additional tax changes announced in the Budget will also add further pressure to Poundlands cost base, it added. Retailers have been among the most vocal of businesses criticising the NI increase and the rise in the minimum wage, which will both happen in April. Tesco, Amazon, Greggs, Next and dozens of other chains last year wrote to the Treasury urging it reconsider some of the Budget measures. The government has defended the tax rise as necessary to avoid cuts to public services. The Pepco Group, which owns Pepco and Dealz stores in Europe, is making a profit so is looking at ways to separate itself from Poundland including a potential sale, it said. As part of the plans, former Poundland managing director Barry Williams, who took over as managing director of Pepco in September 2023, will return to his Poundland role. Stephan Borchert, chief executive of Pepco Group, told Reuters there are definitely interested parties for this business and said he was confident Poundlands future would be decided by September this year. Definitely were looking at all options but a sale is possibly a very good option since we believe that the business will do better with a new owner, he said. Pepco Group said its ultimate ambition is to operate under the single Pepco brand, focusing on its more profitable higher clothing and general merchandise ranges. It is also considering separating out the well-performing Dealz Poland.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg8jqw3wx9o,2025-03-08
Jack Daniel's maker says Canada taking bottles off shelves 'worse than tariffs',"Canadian provinces pulling US alcohol off store shelves in response to Trump trade policy is worse than tariffs, the boss of Jack Daniels maker Brown-Forman has said. Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario, which is by far the most populated, took action this week in retaliation for US tariffs on Canadian goods. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday. Brown-Forman boss Lawson Whiting said the Canadian response was disproportionate to the 25 levies on Canadian goods imposed by the Trump administration. I mean, thats worse than a tariff, because its literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves, Mr Whiting said. In response to the tariffs, Canada has retaliated with 25 levies on goods imported from the US, including beer, spirits, and wine. Some provinces also took action themselves, including Ontario and Nova Scotia. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly 1bn of US alcohol per year. As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves, Mr Ford said on Tuesday. The LCBO is the exclusive wholesaler in Ontario, which means other retailers, bars and restaurants in the province will no longer be able to restock US products, Mr Ford said. Nevertheless, Mr Whiting said Canada makes up only 1 of Brown-Formans total sales, so the firm can withstand the hit. Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Some Canadians have been turning to local goods anyway in response to the Trump tariffs. Canadas prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticised the US tariffs on Tuesday, saying imposing them was a very dumb thing to do. He also accused the US president of planning a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us. Trump has made a number of remarks about making Canada the 51st state of his country, which Canadas Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has said she takes very seriously. Washington has also placed 25 tariffs on Mexico, although Trump has said he will temporarily spare carmakers in both Canada and Mexico from the taxes. Trump has accused both Canada and Mexico of failing to do enough to stem the flow of the fentanyl opioid into the US, an argument that has been rejected by both countries. Mr Whiting said Brown-Forman was going to see what happens in Mexico, which accounted for 7 of its sales in 2024.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0422zzpw8o,2025-03-08
Worst train stations for cancellations named and shamed for first time,"Millions of passengers will see train cancellation and delay data published prominently at more than 1,700 railway stations in England from Thursday. The data will update every 28 days showing statistics for the most recent month in a bid to increase transparency and to hold operators to account. The government says performance information will appear on large digital display boards, with smaller stations displaying QR codes for passengers to scan on smartphones. Ince and Elton in Cheshire was the worst performing station for cancellations in the four weeks to 1 February, according to data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). The BBC understands that the data will not be announced audibly for people with print disabilities but the government says online data will be posted on a new portal which has been made accessible to screen reader users such as those who are blind and visually-impaired. The concept of publishing train reliability data is not new. The ORR publishes performance statistics which detail the percentage of services that are delayed or cancelled. Between 1 October and 31 December 2024, some 5.1 of train services were cancelled and only 62.1 of services were on time, according to the ORR. However, this is the first time that potentially embarrassing information is being proactively presented to millions of train passengers in England each day. And it is the first time the ORR is publishing monthly figures on the worst performing stations for the whole of England, Wales and Scotland. Though the data covers all three countries, the Department for Transport only has the power to display it in English stations. The devolved Welsh and Scottish transport departments currently have no plans to display the figures in their stations. The data also reveals how individual train operators are performing at each station. Train operators say cancellations are not always in their control and that the ORR data does not reflect cases when operators plug a gap in their services with another train. Source: Office of Rail and Road. Covers the period 5 January to 1 February As well as revealing the worst performers, the data also reveals that 33 stations of out of over 18,000 had no cancellations in the four-week period. Buckenham in Norfolk was the only station with a perfect score. It had no cancellations or unscheduled stops and all trains arrived on time or within three minutes, although only 100 trains stopped there in the month. Travellers in Reading were generally supportive of having the data on display in the station, though questioned what it would achieve. I think its a long time coming, said Charlotte from London. You need to have better communication. Rachel Alexander from Reading was keen to see the data display followed up with action. It would help if theyre doing something about it to have less cancellations and have more trains, she said. The move has been welcomed by the independent passenger watchdog, Transport Focus.

European Central Bank cuts interest rates again,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut interest rates for the sixth time in nine months as it seeks to bolster eurozone economic growth. The bank stuck to its plan to lower rates in the face of economic challenges, including threats of US tariffs and plans to boost European military spending. The ECB cut its main interest rate to 2.5 from 2.75, and once again reduced its forecasts for economic growth in the eurozone. The latest cut came as a sell-off of German government bonds spread to other bond markets, including the UK. The sell-off came after Germanys move this week to increase military and infrastructure spending. Political parties in talks to form a new government plan to pay for this by loosening Germanys fiscal rules, raising the prospect of a big increase in debt. In response, longer term German bonds saw their biggest sell-off in years on Wednesday. This pushed borrowing costs - as measured by the yields on the Germanys 10-year bonds - up by biggest daily amount since May 1997. On Thursday, German borrowing costs - as measured by the yields on the countrys bonds - continued to rise. Yields continued to rise on Thursday, hitting 2.929 at one point - the highest level since October 2023. The increase has had a knock-on effect on other countries, with UK borrowing costs also increasing. UK government borrowing costs have already risen due to concerns about persistent inflation and interest rates not coming down as quickly as previously thought. However, Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilters, said the market was still expecting the Bank of England to make two further rate cuts in 2025, with recent inflation data reasonably encouraging. With inflation getting closer to its 2 target, the ECB said its interest rate cuts were making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. But it trimmed its prediction for eurozone growth, putting expansion in 2025 at just 0.9, only slightly above the 0.7 pace recorded last year. The ECB faces a number of upcoming challenges as it tries to get inflation to its 2 target. The eurozone economy may suffer if the Trump administration goes ahead with plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes US imports.",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30mz648nyno,2025-03-08
Are Scottish students using AI to cheat their way to a degree?,"More than 600 Scottish students were accused of misusing AI during part of their studies last year - a rise of 121 on 2023 figures. According to a freedom of information request by BBC Scotland, less than 10 students were kicked off their courses at both Robert Gordon and Glasgow universities in the last year - the first time AI-linked expulsions have been recorded at any Scottish university. So when does turning to the internet to help find the answer to a question cross the line into cheating? Thats the big issue facing Scottish universities, as day-to-day reliance on generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as Chat GPT, becomes the norm. Dylan Walch is an education advisor with the University of Edinburghs Students Association and said the number of staff and students seeking advice around the use of AI was on the rise. He says students who are already using AI often come to the association to seek clarity around its use, while a minority have been caught misusing it. He told BBC Scotland News that low-level cases would prompt a discussion with a lecturer which might lead to a small mark deduction, but in more severe cases the university would interview the student in front of a panel. It can be quite intimidating and quite a big procedure and they can lose anywhere from 10 to 50 marks, he said. Scotland has a student population of 292,240. Figures among AI misuse remain low, but academics say it poses a real challenge around keeping the grading process fair. Prof Sian Bayne is leading the research around the use of AI in higher education at the University of Edinburgh and says it is a complex debate. The most high-profile concern has been around misconduct and cheating in assessments by generating essays and coursework, she said. I think one of my main concerns is theres increasing research which shows that it enables a cognitive offloading, instead of reading a complex text and analysing it, its much easier to put a complex text into generative AI and get that generative AI to do that complex work for them. Only two universities in Scotland, Robert Gordon and Abertay, have dedicated software to help detect the misuse of AI, yet misuse rates remain higher at other universities - with Stirling recording the highest level at 262 cases in the last year. Some institutions are thinking about investing in generative AI detection software, Prof Bayne said. She said lecturers were pretty good at spotting work turned in using AI, but warned that would become more difficult as the technology evolved. She said: At the moment we are thinking about ways which we can redesign assessment so that were using more multi-model methods like images, audio and video or more oral assessments or more in-person exams, as other ways of protecting against that kind of misconduct. BBC Scotland News met a group of Edinburgh university students who argue that AI serves them more as a tool than a shortcut when it comes to their learning.

Denmark postal service to stop delivering letters,"Denmarks state-run postal service, PostNord, is to end all letter deliveries at the end of 2025, citing a 90 decline in letter volumes since the start of the century. The decision brings to an end 400 years of the companys letter service. Denmarks 1,500 post boxes will start to disappear from the start of June. Transport Minister Thomas Danielsen sought to reassure Danes, saying letters would still be sent and received as there is a free market for both letters and parcels. Postal services across Europe are grappling with the decline in letter volumes. Germanys Deutsche Post said on Thursday it was axing 8,000 jobs, in what it called a socially responsible manner. Deutsche Post has 187,000 employees and staff representatives said they feared more cuts were to come. Denmark had a universal postal service for 400 years until the end of 2023, but as digital mail services have taken hold, the use of letters has fallen dramatically. PostNord says it will switch its focus to parcel deliveries and that any postage stamps bought this year or in 2024 can be refunded for a limited period in 2026. Fifteen hundred workers face losing their jobs, out of a workforce of 4,600. Its a super sad day. Not just for our department, but for the 1,500 who face an uncertain future, employee Anders Raun Mikkelsen told Danish broadcaster DR. Denmark ranks as one of the worlds most digitalised countries. Theres an app for almost everything: few people use cash, and Danes even carry drivers licences and health cards on their smartphones. Bank statements, bills, and correspondence from local authorities are all sent electronically. Public services send communications via a Digital Post app or other platforms and PostNord Denmark says the letter market is no longer profitable. Letter numbers have fallen since the start of the century from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year. The decision will affect elderly people most. Although 95 of Danes use the Digital Post service, a reported 271,000 people still rely on physical mail. There are many who are very dependent on letters being delivered regularly. These include hospital appointments, vaccinations or decisions regarding home care, Marlene Rishoj Cordes, from Aeldre Sagen (DaneAge) told Denmarks TV2. PostNord has weathered years of financial struggles and last year was running a deficit. Danish MP Pelle Dragsted blamed privatisation for the move and complained the move would disadvantage people living in remote areas. The introduction of a new Postal Act in 2024 opened up the letter market to competition from private firms and mail is no longer exempted from VAT, resulting in higher postage costs. When a letter costs 29 Danish krone (3.35; 4.20) there will be fewer letters, PostNord Denmarks Managing Director, Kim Pedersen, told local media. He said Danes had become increasingly digital and the decline in letter volumes had become so pronounced that it had fallen by as much as 30 in the past year alone. PostNord also operates...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg8jllq283o,2025-03-08
Banks to pay customers millions after month's worth of IT outages,"Nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years, figures published by a group of MPs show. The Treasury Committee - which has been investigating the impact of banking IT failures - compelled Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to provide the data. It does not include the Barclays outage in January or the Lloyds outage last week - two incidents which occurred on payday for many people, and left customers unable to pay their staff and bills. The report finds Barclays could now face compensation payments of 12.5m. For families and individuals living pay cheque to pay cheque, losing access to banking services on payday can be a terrifying experience, said Dame Meg Hillier, the committees chair. The fact there has been enough outages to fill a whole month within the last two years shows customers frustrations are completely valid, she added. Speaking on the BBCs Today programme, she said she hoped putting the data in the public domain would encourage banks and the regulator to see if there was any more that could be done to reduce the disruption. The Treasury said it was grateful to see the Committees findings. A spokesperson told the BBC that the Treasury is working with the financial authorities to regulate third party suppliers, as well as considering whether the banks are doing all they can to provide the level of service customers expect. But Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, says the findings once again highlights that the traditional banking sector hasnt kept pace with the investment needed to modernise its infrastructure. The findings come as hundreds of Santander customers reported issues affecting access to the banks app and physical banking services on Thursday afternoon. Were aware that customers are currently unable to access some of our services, the company has told customers visiting its websites service status dashboard. Were very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing, and we are working hard to fix the problem as soon as possible. The Treasury Committee data looked at IT failures which affected millions of customers between January 2023 and February this year. They found there had been 158 incidents. While the data does not include the Barclays outage in January, which left one family without a home, the bank told the committee that over half of online payments over the course of the first day of the outage did not work due to severe degradation of their systems performance. That family was Emily McAllister, from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, and her children. Ms McAllister and her 19-year-old daughter Keira, who is autistic and has Downs syndrome, had to spend two nights with her sister and one night at a local hotel after their house move was delayed due to the Barclays outage.

Carmakers win break from Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico,"US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare carmakers from a new 25 import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect. The announcement by the White House came even as Trump continued to blast Canada for not doing enough to stop drugs from entering the US. Nothing has convinced me that it has stopped, Trump wrote on social media after a phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the economic disruption caused by new trade tariffs. News of the relief helped to boost US shares, which closed higher after two days of declines that had wiped out gains the SP 500 had seen since the presidential election in November. The tariff exemption is for cars made in North America that comply with the continents existing free trade agreement. That deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had backed a one-month exemption to the tariffs for the car industry after pleas from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which have supply chains that stretch across North America. The new tariffs - which are a tax applied as goods enter the country - were poised to disrupt a third of car production in North America within a week, according to analysts at SP Global Mobility. Shares in Ford were up by more than 5 after the announcement, while General Motors shares rose more than 7. Stellantis shares in the US rose more than 9. The president is open to hearing about additional exemptions, Ms Leavitt added. He always has open dialogue and hell always do what he believes is right for the American people. Ford said in a statement the company will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration and touted its investment of billions in the United States. Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that affordability would be hurt and business relationships would suffer, despite the chances for targeted relief. Weve seen this movie before. President Trump puts tariffs in place and then doles out exemptions one at a time, said Matthew Holmes, the organisations chief of public policy. That is not how a long-lasting trade alliance is built. Ontario Premier Doug Ford told Canadian media that the one-month reprieve for automakers would not alter his plans for retaliation, which have already included a halt to sales of US liquor in the province. Trumps moves, and his threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world, have raised fears of a wider trade war. As well as Mexico and Canada, he hit goods from China with an additional tariff on Tuesday, raising levies to at least 20 and prompting the country to retaliate against US exports, including agricultural products. Canada also responded with its o...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zn47d5j1o,2025-03-08
Warning people in UK could have less money due to US tariffs,"US president Donald Trumps tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers pockets, the governor of the Bank of England has warned. Tariffs could hit growth and pose substantial risks to the UK and world economies, Andrew Bailey told MPs. Other Bank experts also said trade frictions could hurt companies in the UK and elsewhere. Mr Bailey urged for trade disputes to be settled globally, and stressed the importance of trade. The US has been ratcheting up trade tensions, and this week imposed new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and doubled the levy recently put on Chinese goods. Speaking to MPs about the effects of Trump tariffs, Mr Bailey said: The risks to the UK economy, and indeed the world economy, are substantial. When asked whether Trump tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers pockets, Mr Bailey said Yes. We serve the people, and we have to take it very seriously. Megan Greene, a member of the Banks monetary policy committee, said there is a lack of certainty about how far the US will go in implementing tariffs, and about how countries will respond. But tariffs could affect the UK economy in a number of ways, she said. If there are tariffs imposed on UK goods going into the US, this would put downward pressure on the UK economy, because firms would find it harder to sell to US consumers. But that could also lower inflation, the pace at which prices rise. If supply chains fragmented and had to be reordered this would hit UK growth and push up inflation. Ultimately, tariffs would push down on growth, Greene said, adding that there was a tonne of uncertainty about how Trumps tariffs would play out, but there would probably be more negatives for UK the economic activity than positives. Professor Alan Taylor, who is also a monetary policy committee member, agreed the risks to the economy outweigh the upsides, and that is true for people around the country and around the world. He added: If you put sand in those wheels of trade were going to be worse off on some margin. Mr Bailey said he agreed very strongly with the assessment of the committee members. Trade supports growth. Openness supports the spread of innovation and ideas, he said. Bailey called for trade disputes to be settled via the World Trade Organization, rather than thrashed out between the US and other countries. Mr Trump and his administration have said higher tariffs on goods imported into the US will help it get better deals with allies and rivals around the world. But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world. Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises. Some of Trumps allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing. Bailey said the move would be a very damaging thing for the world...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdelzez04z5o,2025-03-08
Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed,"Ministers, facing potential cuts of billions of pounds from the welfare budget, have announced plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work. The coaches are already employed by job centres but will be redeployed to focus on tackling economic inactivity, said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). It said the staff would provide personalised and intensive support to thousands of sick and disabled people. But the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on people on low incomes, said only a tiny percentage would actually find a job. The coaches will offer tailored employment support to people on health-related benefits and help them access support with writing CVs and interview techniques, the government said. Ministers hope moving thousands of people into jobs will help them unlock the benefits of work and cut the rapidly rising cost of health and disability benefits. But the Resolution Foundation said only about 3 of the hundreds of thousands of people likely to lose benefit payments were likely to find a job. In a report called Delivering the Undeliverable, the researchers argue the causes of the rising welfare costs include the country getting older and sicker and that while ministers are keen on quick financial cuts, truly effective reforms will take time to deliver. The government described the 1,000 redeployed work coaches as a downpayment on plans to overhaul employment support, set to be unveiled within weeks. The current system fails to intervene early enough to stop people becoming unemployed and misses opportunities to support their return, the DWP said. It has become defined by poor experiences and low trust among many people who use it, it added. Some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness, the department said. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase on the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the broken welfare system Labour had inherited was failing sick and disabled people, is bad for the taxpayer, and holding the economy back. For too long, sick, and disabled people have been told they cant work, denied support, and locked out of jobs, with all the benefits that good work brings, she said. But many sick and disabled people want and can work, with the right support. Selected figures published from a survey for the government suggest 44 of disabled people and those with a health condition in the UK do not trust the DWP to help people reach their full career potential. The same proportion believe DWP does not provide enough support to those out of work because of disability, ill health or a long-term health condition, according to the survey.

US charges Chinese hackers who targeted dissidents,"US prosecutors have charged 12 Chinese nationals for being part of an alleged hacking scheme, which sold data of US-based dissidents to the Chinese government. The state-sponsored operation also targeted government agencies including the Treasury, according to the Justice Department (DOJ). Hackers also allegedly targeted an American religious organisation, and a newspaper in Hong Kong, the statement added. China has not responded to these specific allegations, but have strongly denied other accusations in the past. In December, the Treasury Department reported a major breach by Chinese -sponsored hackers, saying they were able to access employee workstations and some unclassified documents. At that time, China denied any involvement, calling the accusation baseless and saying it consistently opposes all forms of hacking. It is unclear when the latest DOJ charges were issued - but they were unsealed in a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday. Among the individuals charged were two officers of Chinas Ministry of Public Security. The DOJ said that hackers, which appeared to represent a private company, i-Soon, charged Chinese agencies between 10,000 and 75,000 for each exploited email inbox. They allegedly conducted computer intrusions under the direction of Chinese ministries and on their own initiative, and were paid handsomely for stolen data. Today, we are exposing the Chinese government agents directing and fostering indiscriminate and reckless attacks against computers and networks worldwide, said Sue J Bai, who heads the DOJs National Security Division. We will continue to fight to dismantle this ecosystem of cyber mercenaries and protect our national security, she added. No further details on the targeted US-based dissidents were provided. The religious organisation hit by hackers was described as one which previously sent missionaries to China and was openly critical of the PRC government. PRC is short for the Peoples Republic of China. A Hong Kong newspaper was also on the list. While it was not named, the statement said that it was considered as being opposed to the PRC government. Besides US agencies, hackers were said to have targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea and Indonesia. Last October, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said hacks targeting two major US presidential campaigns were carried out by actors affiliated with the Peoples Republic of China. Earlier last year, seven Chinese nationals were charged with running a hacking operation that lasted at least 14 years and targeted foreign critics of China. Operations linked by Western governments to China have also targeted the UKs Electoral Commission, and the UK and New Zealand parliaments. As part of its long-running rewards programme, the US State Department said it was offering up to 10m for information on i-Soon, its employees and Chinese officials engaged in malicious cyber activities highlighted in the Department of Just...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4nw84dzr8o,2025-03-08
Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions,"The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the governments official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellors financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said the world has changed since Rachel Reevess Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had 9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. The OBRs forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK. The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its major measures -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellors self-imposed rules on borrowing money. The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending. Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are non-negotiable. The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March. The Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes, a government insider told the BBC. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellors response later this month. Insiders expect politically painful new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4s Today programme there had been a huge rise in the welfare budget and there were too many young people not in work, education or training. Theres a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and theres a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable, she added. Reeves has previously pledged fundamental reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits. Last year, the government spent 65bn on sickness benefits - a 25 increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around 100bn before the next general election. Some of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives which encourag...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lpjqg2mp5o,2025-03-08
Co-op admits unlawfully blocking rival store openings,"The Co-op has admitted breaching rules to prevent rival supermarkets from opening nearby more than 100 times. The UKs competition watchdog found Co-op had breached an order which limits supermarkets ability to prevent nearby land being used by rival retailers across England, Scotland and Wales. Blocking other grocers from opening nearby hits competition between supermarkets and means shoppers have less choice when trying to get cheaper prices, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said. A spokesperson for Co-op said: This is a matter we take very seriously, and we have taken all necessary action to ensure this issue is resolved and does not happen again. The Co-op admitted 107 breaches of the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010. It has re-written 104 agreements and agreed to resolve three others, the CMA said. It released a list of the 107 locations and in an open letter to the Co-op, the CMA said it was concerned by the very large number of breaches. The Co-ops spokesperson added: As a business that is committed to operating fairly, we recognise this is extremely disappointing. The Co-op owns almost 2,400 stores across the UK and holds a 5.2 market share in the UKs 190.9bn supermarket industry, according to the CMA. The chain said the number of breaches amounted to less than 2 of transactions across its property portfolio, which includes its supermarkets and funeral directors. Many of the UKs biggest supermarkets have also breached the land order in recent years, but not to the extent that Co-op was found to in the CMAs latest action. Last year Morrisons had the highest number of breaches of the order at 55. The order bans new restrictive covenants which prohibit land being used for a supermarket. It also bans exclusivity arrangements which prevent landlords from allowing stores to compete with an existing supermarket which were over five years long. Daniel Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA said: Restrictive agreements by our leading retailers affect competition between supermarkets and impact shoppers trying to get the best deals. Lee Tiso, 57, from Scotland said the lack of choice where he lives means he struggles to shop around to save money. He said: I live in Lochgilphead, which is a remote area of the Argyll. Co-op and Tesco have small stores here. The nearest Aldi and Lidl are 40 miles away in Oban and the nearest Poundland or Home Bargains is on the outskirts of Glasgow and 68 miles away. We are forced to pay whatever Co-op charges. Its a similar issue for Maureen Loftus who moved to the Isle of Skye in Scotland. She said the only stores nearby are a Co-op supermarket, a Co-op convenience store and a Spar. I dont know why other supermarkets arent here considering the consumer demand? she said. She added Tesco, Asda and Morrisons make daily deliveries to a small number of click and collect points on the island - but the slots are so in demand that to get an easy slot she has to travel to another...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2gwwnd0wo,2025-03-08
UK competition watchdog drops Microsoft-OpenAI probe,"The UK competition watchdog has ended its investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was looking into whether Microsofts relationship with what is the worlds best known artificial intelligence (AI) firm changed after the turmoil which saw its boss Sam Altman fired and then rehired. The CMA has concluded that, despite Microsoft investing billions of dollars into OpenAI and having exclusive uses of some of its AI products, the partnership remains the same, so is not subject to review under the UKs merger rules. Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been defanged. The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked. In view of Microsofts potentially important role in securing Sam Altmans re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAIs commercial policy, the watchdog said. But on Wednesday, it concluded Microsoft exerts a high level of material influence over OpenAIs commercial policy without fully controlling it. Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UKs merger control regime, CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn. But he added: The CMAs findings on jurisdiction should not be read as the partnership being given a clean bill of health on potential competition concerns; but the UK merger control regime must of course operate within the remit set down by Parliament. Critics though say the decision is linked to the changed political environment the CMA is now operating in. The government has instructed the countrys regulators to suggest ways of stimulating economic growth. In January, the government removed the then chair of the CMA, Marcus Bokkerink, because it was unhappy with his response to that call. He was replaced on an interim basis by Doug Gurr, former boss of Amazon UK. The CMA has sat on this decision for over a year, yet within just a few weeks of a former Amazon boss being installed as chair, it has decided everything was absolutely fine all along, nothing to see here, said Foxglove co-executive director Rosa Curling. This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech  just like they did the last one, she told the BBC. When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamfords LinkedIn post, where he said: We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment. He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and Ope...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd87dxezvo,2025-03-08
Sweden is 'no longer a country that cannot be trusted',"War, cross-border conflict and geopolitical upheaval are rarely deemed good for business. Yet that appears to have been the impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine on two of the aggressors neighbours to its west  Finland and Sweden. Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations response to the invasion that turned fear into hope. Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion. Less than three years later, theyre both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics. Were no longer a country that cannot be trusted, observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nations previous historic neutrality. He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Natos ordering from defence firms. Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into whats going on inside the alliance. We couldnt access NSPAs before, he says. Jukka Siukosaari, Finlands Ambassador to the UK, agrees. Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond. Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending. Presently, only 23 of the organisations 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2 of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance. Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA. Natos newest members spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4 and Sweden 2.2 of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6 and 3 in the next three years. Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europes northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland. Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finlands, Swedens, Norways and Denmarks 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence. In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out. And while the White House this week announced a pause in US military aid to Ukraine, European leaders have declared theyre in it for the long haul, so here too we can expect substantial and ongoi...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjyxljyjxno,2025-03-08
Why detecting methane is difficult but crucial work,"In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is. Theyre armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies. But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen. Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes. A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma. Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation. Its very heartbreaking and alarming when youre doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they cant change for now, Ms Bah says. Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas. While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation. Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture. But methane is not always easy to notice. It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light. Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful. There is no perfect solution, says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative. There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities. Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says. At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms. Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions. He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger fi...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w51kg8ldo,2025-03-08
Diversity backlash: Is 'masculine energy' coming to the UK?,"Dangerous, demeaning, and immoral. Thats how Donald Trump has described diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes which aim to boost workers from diverse backgrounds. Upon returning to the White House, he ordered the shutdown of all federal DEI initiatives, urging the private sector to follow suit. And many have, with the likes of Walmart, McDonalds, Meta and Amazon ditching or scaling back their diversity policies. Corporations, according to Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, have been neutered and need more masculine energy. Some UK employees fear Trumps rhetoric could normalise intolerant attitudes in the workplace, even if DEI policies remain intact. Someone that is at the top saying things like that sets a precedent that its okay to do so, says Chloe, who works at a London-based finance company. Stefan Hoops, the head of Deutsche Banks investment arm, also said he feared Trumps language would lead us straight back to the macho Wolf of Wall Street era and called on companies to ensure equal opportunities. He posted his thoughts on LinkedIn alongside a picture of him lifting weights, saying, I figured a masculine-looking picture would balance my anti-anti-woke observations. But so far there is little evidence of UK firms changing their diversity policies. In fact, the UK arm of accountancy giant Deloitte has signalled a split with its US counterpart by saying it remains committed to our diversity goals, not long after staff in the US were told there were plans to sunset their DEI goals. In the UK, the Equality Act protects against discrimination and since 2017, organisations with over 250 employees must report their gender pay gap. In addition, any company listed on the stock exchange is required to publish board diversity data against set targets, including that at least 40 of board members should be women. Pavita Cooper is the UK chair of the 30 Club, which campaigns to increase gender diversity in senior management. She says the UKs legal system will help protect DEI policies. In the US, they are talking a lot about affirmative action and woke ideology. In the UK, we focus a lot more on positive action, Ms Cooper says. She explains that affirmative action involves quotas, while positive action encourages participation without preferential treatment, such as through scholarships or mentoring. Martha Lane Fox, who has worked to promote diversity in the tech sector, believes the UK has an opportunity to lean into diversity - stand apart from the US. She points out the irony of Elon Musk, tasked by Donald Trump with slashing federal government spending, standing in the Oval Office with his young son as he dismantled DEI programmes. Imagine if everyone had such casual and extraordinary opportunities for childcare, what could we unlock? However, Baroness Lane Fox, who is chair of the British Chambers of Commerce business group, says the UK still has a long way to go in terms of representation, pointing out that there is only one disabled person o...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2365p3m4ko,2025-03-08
Switzerland targets rich tourists but at what cost?,"The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy. Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too. So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, its an opportunity. In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists. Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guests wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer ski butlers to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots. Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend. But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures. Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8 of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25 of Switzerlands total revenue from tourism. The numbers speak for themselves, says Mr Berger. The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests. Whats more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong. Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices, Mr Berger explains. There is always somewhere cheaper. Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts. But its not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerlands most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market. A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hun...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yy09we1eo,2025-03-08
Can AI help modernise Ireland's healthcare system?,"For a country famous as Big Techs European address, Irelands hospitals often lag far behind in technology. They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics. In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublins Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its AE. Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health systems entire computer network, and published 520 peoples medical records online. But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare. That includes a programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its 22.9bn (20bn; 24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UKs or Canadas. To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved. Its a problem being tackled at Dublins Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Irelands busiest emergency department. Thats especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish AE departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen. In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI magnetic resonance imaging or CT computed tomography scans, says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater. Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment. To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures. The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they dont have experienced consultants to turn to. Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isnt alone, theyve got a wing man, he says. Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges. Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends. Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin. But now, Prof MacMahon and the Maters AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a synthetic MRI from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries. That was done by feeding a generative AI model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person. Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments. And since radiology scans also come with doctors text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends. Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the countr...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7yxm3py5o,2025-03-08
Countries compete to keep skilled young workers,"In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsofts Dublin subsidiary. A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsofts headquarters in Seattle, where he still works. Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career. Mr Diass decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving. The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous. I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldnt be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level, says. A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbons Instituto Superior Técnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to 35,000 (36,000; 29,000). But his take home salary was much, much less. His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40 of this gross salary went to the state. Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didnt live with my parents, he recalls. Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to 60,000. The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of 160,000 before a 20 income tax rate, much lower than at home. Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years time with with many more savings. Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments. In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Partys Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education. In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data. After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels. The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance. But specialists say it likely wont be enough to keep the young from going abroad. It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under 28,000, says Sérgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Católica Lisbon School of Law. He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average workers salary than most richer nations.

What minerals does Ukraine have and what are they used for?,"Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign a deal with the US on the joint development of his countrys mineral deposits at any time and in any convenient format. It comes days after an acrimonious visit to Washington, during which Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance in front of journalists and TV cameras. The deal was supposed to be signed during that visit, but was put on hold as the Ukrainian president left the White House early. Days later, in a social media statement which came hours after the US paused all military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky expressed his gratitude over American support for Ukraine and said he was ready to sign the deal. Trump said he appreciated the message, although it is not clear if or when the deal will be signed. Kyiv estimates that about 5 of the worlds critical raw materials are in Ukraine. This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation one of the top five leading countries for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles. Ukraine has 7 of Europes supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations. It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors. Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant. Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world. Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraines economy minister, resources worth 350bn (277bn) remain in occupied territories today. In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63 of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits. Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a strategic and economic dimension in Russias continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains. Critical minerals are the foundation of the 21st Century economy, Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics, he said. Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraines mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75 of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group. In December, China banned th...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20le8jn282o,2025-03-08
Can Canadians get the world drinking tree sap?,"While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world. We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes. What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2 natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet. A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes. People feel like theyre drinking the wild Canadian forest, says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City. Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product  coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts. As Canada is far and away the worlds largest producer of maple syrup  accounting for more than 80 of production  it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90 of Canadas maple syrup. Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. Nobody previously thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup. He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner Stéphane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace. Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75 of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings. Its more than just a local product at this point, adds Mr Leclerc. For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled 506m (409m), with that expected to jump to 2.6bn by 2033. By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached 7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to 22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up. Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was 1.7bn last year, according to one study. Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits. When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants, she says. So theyre gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery. However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water wa...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde98k6e2dno,2025-03-08
Will quantum computers disrupt critical infrastructure?,"Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky. Much to everyones relief the impact turned out to be minimal. Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the worlds digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated. Thats because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack. Quantum computing is radically different to the classical computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states  one or zero, on or off  quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions. The reason why its so powerful is because youre doing all those possible computations simultaneously, Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means its much, much more efficient, much, much more powerful. This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems. The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across todays computer networks. Todays computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes. This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. Anything thats protected by something thats vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers, says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2. Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away. But progress is being made. In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key breakthroughs and paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer. Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Todays systems have a few hundred at most. But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices. Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, What data in your organization is valuable for that period of time? ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq9zxxn72qo,2025-03-08
Georgia's richest man said to be moving funds to avoid US sanctions,"Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the countrys politics, Georgias parliament rushed through amendments to the nations tax code. Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change  which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia  may have been introduced to serve the interests of the countrys richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. He is the founder and honorary chairman of the countrys ruling party, Georgian Dream. Now it is clear, those changes were made for him, says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze. With an estimated wealth of 4.9bn (3.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies. Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the countrys MPs passed the contentious transparency on foreign influence bill, often dubbed the foreign agents law. Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20 of their funding from abroad have to register as organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power, submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country. Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police. In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year. There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili. The motion expressed deep concern at the suspension of Georgias EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters. TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. All his big business, which he has in Georgia, in the hospitality sector, in the energy sector, all the parent companies of these Georgian companies, the last beneficiaries are registered in these so-called offshore territories, says Beso Namchavadze. He adds that TI Georgia believes that Mr Ivanishvili and other family members are continuing to transfer ownership of companies they previously controlled through offshore entities to newly established firms in Georgia.

Hair: 'It’s just thrown away but it's gold',"Zeeshan Ali has been a drag artist for 10 years and has taken his show all over India. Central to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs. Its an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage, says Ali, who is based in Mumbai. But getting that look right wasnt easy in the early days. When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric, he says. But things are different now. The trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. Its no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement. Indian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the worlds biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85 of global demand. Kolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish. My parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same, he says. Hair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair. It requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value. Its just thrown away but its gold, says Mr Venkatesh. Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and 1 (0.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair. Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices. For the individual picker, theres not much money in it. A diligent collector might gather 15 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to 6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas, says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him. While our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices. Most of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs. China has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars, says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government. If India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do. When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up, Mr Cherian says. He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry. It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated ha...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dl93l7w2go,2025-03-08
Scientists work on 'superhuman' vision systems for robots,"If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, youre going to need some smoke. But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot. Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off. The whole building got triggered, says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. My student called me. He was very surprised. The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system. Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain  or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons. But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors. However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves. Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather. But the spinning array on Prof Zhaos robot throws radio waves in all directions. An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information. What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision  to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot, explains Prof Zhao. He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building. Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms. Although humans cant see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light. Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections. The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles. Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light. Its really very interesting work and quite impressive, says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms. One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2l1y73mz1o,2025-03-08
Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?,"Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans dont buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe? Italys ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans dont take our cars. Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. Ive done it, and its very difficult. Add cost to the question, and it becomes obvious why you dont see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers  Traders, which represents the industry in the UK. We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles. Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. They pay per gallon what we pay per litre, he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon. Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others. In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth 36bn (37bn; 30bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for 5.2bn. This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump. Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal, explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EUs 10 tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5 tariffs the US  currently - charges on cars imported from the EU. These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25 import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers. Trumps move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europes automotive industry from a potential trade war. Trumps intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. So far what weve been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos, NBC News recently reported him as saying. In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. If you can help it, you dont want to ship cars around the world. Theyre big boxes of expensive air, he says. The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMTs Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to manufacture close to where the customer is based. As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8kn5v37wxo,2025-03-08
Erasing Escobar: Will Colombia ban the sale of memorabilia of the drug lord?,"A proposed law in Colombias Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose cocaine cartel has been linked to thousands of murders. One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news. His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning. I remember leaving and seeing my mum and grandma waiting for me, crying, says Mr Rojas, who was just 10-years-old at the time. It was a very, very sad day. Minutes after take off, an explosion on board Avianca flight 203 killed the 107 passengers and crew, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris. The blast wasnt an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medellín cartel. While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombias past, Escobars legacy has not. The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos. In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors. But a proposed law in Colombias Congress is seeking to change this. The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings. Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner, says Juan Sebastián Gómez, Congress member and co-author of the bill. The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses. Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods. This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well, says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medellín. Medellín, Escobars hometown, was known as the most dangerous city in the world in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombias armed conflict. Today its been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar. This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids, says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.

Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?,"For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germanys industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the countrys famous post-war economic miracle. Its Big Three brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery? When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europes biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away. Wolfsburg is Germanys answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you dont work in the factory yourself, its certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school. Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - its kind of a synonym, explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Groups in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus  a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry. Were proud of the plant, he says. It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle. Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the countrys economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy  and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role. Car-making makes up about a fifth of the countrys manufacturing ...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6pzwj6qq7o,2025-03-08
Why do kindness influencers get criticised?,"Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied. The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message. It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile, says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia. The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell. I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit, he says. Kindness content creators, or influencers as theyre often called, are increasing in numbers on social media. Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut. Kindness is cool, says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers. Mr Dereniowskis videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money. I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story and often the people who have the least give the most, says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers. Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brands product. The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular? Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments. Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content. On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism? While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives, says Ms Cleary.

Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?,"President Trumps sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as weve seen - be used as a bargaining chip. The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25 duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25 tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We dont yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade. Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and  amidst the inevitable retaliation - backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era? I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trumps policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers. Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people. Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as the most beautiful word in the dictionary - which is really intriguing. Whats the attraction for him? Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a beautiful thing for several reasons. Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of 1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and weve seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days. Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years. He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs. DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trumps economic goals? JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than weve seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.

How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe,"Its a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the citys Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies. Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovias historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid. There was a moment during Covid when I thought maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before, says Elena Mirón, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city. But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. Im happy, because I can live off this job I love. Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the worlds biggest foreign tourist hub. And the tourism industrys post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozones fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2 last year. By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2 in 2024, while France grew by 1.1, Italy by 0.5, and the UK by an expected 0.9. This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the worlds best-performing economy. The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth, says Carlos Cuerpo, the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40 of eurozone growth last year. Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11 in one year. We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth, he adds. That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EUs Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to 163bn by 2026 (169bn; 136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy. Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses. Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic, says María Jesús Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spains IESE Business School. Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade p...",Business,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7jmlyx02o,2025-03-08
Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook,"President Trump inherited an economy that was, by most conventional measures, firing on all cylinders. Wages, consumer spending and corporate profits were rising. Unemployment was low. The inflation rate, though higher than normal, was falling. Just weeks into Mr. Trumps term, the outlook is gloomier. Measures of business and consumer confidence have plunged. The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Layoffs are picking up, according to some data. And forecasters are cutting their estimates for economic growth this year, with some even predicting that the U.S. gross domestic product could shrink in the first quarter. Some commentators have gone further, arguing that the economy could be headed for a recession, a sharp rebound in inflation or even the dreaded combination of the two, stagflation. Most economists consider that unlikely, saying growth is more likely to slow than to give way to a decline. Still, the sudden deterioration in the outlook is striking, especially because it is almost entirely a result of Mr. Trumps policies and the resulting uncertainty. Tariffs, and the inevitable retaliation from trading partners, will increase prices and slow down growth. Federal job cuts will push up unemployment, and could lead government employees and contractors to pull back on spending while they wait to learn their fate. Deportations could drive up costs for industries like construction and hospitality that depend on immigrant labor. If the economy was starting out in quite good shape, its probably in less good shape after what weve seen the last few weeks, said Donald Rissmiller, chief economist at Strategas, a research firm. The U.S. economy has repeatedly shown its resilience in recent years, and there are parts of Mr. Trumps agenda that could foster growth. Business groups have responded enthusiastically to Republican plans to cut taxes and reduce regulation. A streamlined government could, in theory, make the overall economy more productive.

Stock Market Has Worst Weekly Drop in Months as Tariffs Hang Over Wall St.,"The stock market suffered its worst week in many months, after a series of dizzying policy shifts on tariffs from the White House amid simmering concerns about the health of the economy. The SP 500 seesawed throughout the day on Friday, marking a volatile end to a turbulent week, as investors parsed the latest employment data and comments from the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, about the direction of interest rates. Even though the index ended the day with a gain, the SP 500 notched its third consecutive week of losses with a drop of 3.1 percent, its sharpest weekly decline since early September. There has been a sharp mood shift since the index hit a record high less than a month ago, as investors have become worried about the trajectory for economic growth, made worse by tariffs on imports from the countrys largest trading partners. Surveys have also showed mounting concern among consumers. On Friday, investors appeared to take solace from Mr. Powells comments after he struck a positive tone, saying despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to be in a good place. He reiterated the Feds commitment to keep rates steady as it works to bring down inflation. Another positive sign on Friday came from the labor market. With 151,000 jobs added in February, the data showed a pace of hiring moderate enough to temper fears about resurgent inflation, yet robust enough to avoid exacerbating worries about a slowing economy. Lara Castleton, U.S. head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, said the jobs data would probably ease overly sour expectations about the economy. After confidence on the economy has taken a turn, she said, market participants were looking to either confirm or reverse that sentiment. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

U.S. Hiring Holds Steady,"U.S. Economy Employers added 151,000 jobs in February, up from 143,000 in January. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1 percent. Monthly change in jobs 0 100,000 200,000 300,000 Feb.24 March April May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. Jan.25 Feb. 151,000 jobs in February Note: Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Karl Russell Talmon Joseph Smith It could be the calm before a storm, or it may be business as usual. U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in February, the first full month under the new Trump administration, extending a streak of job growth to 50 months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent, from 4 percent. Is DOGE playing a role? The survey showed a decline of 10,000 in federal employment. But the report was based on surveys conducted in the second week of February, and economists say the administrations mass firings, buyouts and hiring freezes at federal agencies may not fully surface in the monthly data until sometime this spring. What about tariffs? A similar wait is in store for those hoping to ascertain the effects that President Trumps tariffs  both those imposed and those still threatened  may have on global trading partners, business investment and employment. Zooming out: Even without the shake-up in foreign trade and federal employment, private-sector hiring has slowed substantially from the blowout pace of 2021 to 2023. That has left labor market analysts and financial commentators gearing up for a potential cooling in economic growth this year. Context: For now, unemployment continues to glide just above record lows. And gains in average hourly earnings for workers have kept up a solid pace, overtaking inflation since mid-2023. What theyre saying: The stock market reacted to the report positively, as did most economists. This is a fundamentally healthy labor market, continuing its earlier momentum, albeit at a slightly slower pace, said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan. A detox period: In an interview Friday morning with CNBC before the release of the data, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asserted that financial markets and the economy overall had become too reliant on government spending and there is going to be a detox period going forward, prompted by Trump administration cutbacks. Other Trump advisers, including Elon Musk, have also issued such warnings. Could we be seeing that this economy that we inherited starting to roll a bit? Sure, Mr. Bessent said. Danielle Kaye After fluctuating this morning, stocks have turned downward, with the SP 500 falling about 0.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite off roughly 0.8 percent. Even though the jobs numbers for February didnt prompt a knee-jerk response from Wall Street, the Trump administrations on-again, off-again approach to tariffs has put investors on edge, raising concerns about the effects on the economy in the months ahead.

Fired Federal Workers Face a Sluggish Job Market,"For about a year now, the labor market has existed in a state of eerie calm: Not many people were losing their jobs or quitting, but not many of those seeking work were getting job offers. The mass layoffs now underway across the federal government, along with its employees who are voluntarily heading for the exits, could disrupt that uneasy equilibrium. While unemployment is relatively low at 4.1 percent, those losing their positions could face a difficult time finding work, depending on how well their skills translate to a private sector that does not seem eager to hire. Federal workers all across the country are starting to look, and its impacting people everywhere, said Cory Stahle, an economist at the job search platform Indeed. Its hard to think this isnt going to stress test the labor market in the coming months. On the eve of the Trump administration, the federal governments executive branch employed about 2.3 million civilians. Its not clear how many of those will end up being cut, and how many will get their jobs back after lawsuits over those terminations work through the courts. But the impact of the pace at which government spending is being slashed, along with instructions from the White House budget office for agencies to slice even deeper, could be meaningful.

"How Dan Bongino Would Run the F.B.I., According to Dan Bongino","To hear Dan Bongino describe it, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is the single most corrupt law enforcement institution in America and a full-blown leftist political action committee devoted to covering up Democratic crimes and withholding the truth from the American people. It is time for an absolute housecleaning, he said in 2023. Now Mr. Bongino  the longtime right-wing pundit, podcaster and vocal ally of President Trump  has been tapped to serve as the agencys new deputy director. His podcast and radio show will end production on March 14. The job, which does not require Senate confirmation, has traditionally been filled by a senior agent with vast operational experience and a deep understanding of how the bureaus various divisions work. The last two deputy directors together had more than 35 years of experience before they assumed the role. Mr. Bongino served as a police officer and a U.S. Secret Service agent years ago, but has no experience with the F.B.I. Mr. Bonginos precise plans for the agency remain opaque, but on recent podcasts he has said he would rid the agency of politicization and focus on crimes like drug dealing  despite the bureaus broad mandate to protect national security, investigate crimes and root out corruption by public officials at all levels. Taken together, Mr. Bonginos years of comments on his radio show and podcast have painted a vision for dramatic change at the F.B.I., as he put it last week. Those ideas largely align with criticisms put forth by his friend Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed as the director of the agency. Some of their ideas, however, would probably require additional funding. The F.B.I. declined to comment, but it recently rejected charges of corruption leveled by a Republican cabinet secretary, saying such claims are not supported by any evidence and undermine the men and women of the F.B.I.

How the Crypto Exchange Bybit Lost $1.5 Billion to North Korean Hackers,"On the night of Feb. 21, Ben Zhou, the chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, logged on to his computer to approve what appeared to be a routine transaction. His company was moving a large amount of Ether, a popular digital currency, from one account to another. Thirty minutes later, Mr. Zhou got a call from Bybits chief financial officer. In a trembling voice, the executive told Mr. Zhou that their system had been hacked. All of the Ethereum is gone, he said. When Mr. Zhou approved the transaction, he had inadvertently handed control of an account to hackers backed by the North Korean government, according to the F.B.I. They stole 1.5 billion in cryptocurrencies, the largest heist in the industrys history. To pull off the astonishing breach, the hackers exploited a simple flaw in Bybits security: its reliance on a free software product. They penetrated Bybit by manipulating a publicly available system that the exchange used to safeguard hundreds of millions of dollars in customer deposits. For years, Bybit had relied on the storage software, developed by a technology provider called Safe, even as other security firms sold more specialized tools for businesses. The hack sent crypto markets into a free fall and undermined confidence in the industry at a crucial time. Under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, industry executives are lobbying for new U.S. laws and regulations that would make it easier for people to pour their savings into digital currencies. On Friday, the White House is scheduled to host a crypto summit with President Trump and top industry officials. Crypto security experts said they were troubled by what the heist revealed about Bybits safety protocols. The losses were completely preventable, one security firm wrote in an analysis of the breach, arguing that it should not have happened. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Many Chinese See a Cultural Revolution in America,"As the United States grapples with the upheaval unleashed by the Trump administration, many Chinese people are finding they can relate to what many Americans are going through. They are saying it feels something like the Cultural Revolution, the period known as the decade of turmoil. The young aides Elon Musk has sent to dismantle the U.S. government reminded some Chinese of the Red Guards whom Mao Zedong enlisted to destroy the bureaucracy at the peak of the Cultural Revolution. Upon hearing President Trumps musing about serving a third term, they joked that Chinas leader, Xi Jinping, must be saying, I know how to do it  he secured one in 2022 by engineering a constitutional change. The United States helped China modernize and expand its economy in the hope that China would become more like America  more democratic and more open. Now for some Chinese, the United States is looking more and more like China. Coming from an authoritarian state, we know that dictatorship is not just a system  it is, at its core, the pursuit of power, Wang Jian, a journalist, wrote in an X post criticizing Mr. Trump. We also know that the Cultural Revolution was about dismantling institutions to expand control. For these Chinese, who strive for democratic values but contend with an authoritarian state, their role model is tearing itself down. They are expressing their alarm in interviews, articles and social media comments that range in emotion from disappointment and anger to sardonic. Beacon of democracy, 1776-2025, wrote a commenter on a post by the official Weibo social media account of the U.S. Embassy in China. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Walgreens to Be Acquired by Sycamore Partners in $10 Billion Deal,"Walgreens Boots Alliance said on Thursday that it had agreed to be acquired by Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm, in a 10 billion deal that will take the struggling pharmacy chain out of the glare of public markets. Walgreens has faced declining prescription reimbursements and falling sales at its retail locations for years  a trend that has hit a number of major pharmacy chains. After rapidly expanding their brick-and-mortar footprint, pharmacy companies now say its harder to turn a profit from selling prescriptions, citing pressure from middlemen. Cautious spending from consumers who have been grappling with inflation, coupled with competition from retail behemoths like Amazon and Walmart, has also dampened pharmacies sales of household items ranging from snacks to cleaning supplies. Walgreens, which owns the Duane Reade chain in the New York City area and the Boots pharmacies in Britain, has been closing stores, with hundreds more set to be shuttered in the years ahead. The buyout follows a roughly 50 percent drop in the companys share price in the past year. Its market value, which peaked at over 100 billion a decade ago, dropped below 8 billion before news of the potential takeover first broke late last year. Sycamore has agreed to pay 11.45 per share, an 8 percent premium from Thursdays closing share price. Signs of strain at the chain have been clear for months. The company reported a net loss of 8.6 billion for the entire 2024 fiscal year, nearly triple the previous years loss. But it beat earnings and revenue expectations in its most recent reported quarter, which ended in November. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump Suspends Mexico and Canada Tariffs on USMCA Goods for a Month,"Two days after imposing sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, President Trump on Thursday abruptly suspended many of those levies, sowing confusion with investors and businesses that depend on trade with the countries. The president said he would allow products that are traded under the rules of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade pact he signed in his first term, to avoid the stiff 25 percent tariffs he imposed just days ago on two of Americas largest trading partners. The suspension effectively abandons many of the tariffs that Mr. Trump had placed on Canadian and Mexican products  levies he said were necessary to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. His decision came a day after he said he would grant a 30-day reprieve to automakers, who had complained to the president that the levies would cause severe damage to U.S. carmakers. Mr. Trump implied that any relief would be short-lived, saying that other tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products are coming in April. Mr. Trumps chaotic, stop-and-start approach has sent stock markets tumbling and generated anxiety among industries that depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, which account for more than a quarter of U.S. imports and nearly a third of U.S. exports. After Mr. Trump imposed his tariffs, Canada retaliated with levies on 20.5 billion worth of American goods, including agricultural products, and Mexico was threatening to impose its own import taxes on U.S. goods on Sunday if Mr. Trump did not relent. Still, the decision to suspend the tariffs did little to calm financial markets, which have been jittery since Mr. Trump ratcheted up his trade war earlier this week. In addition to hitting Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump placed a second 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, prompting another round of retaliation from Beijing on American products. The president has not suspended any of his levies on China.

"Trump’s Tariffs Could Help Tesla, by Hurting Its Rivals More","As President Trump puts new tariffs on goods from China and threatens a trade war with allies like Mexico and Canada, one global company is likely to suffer less than most of its competitors: Tesla. But the electric car maker led by Elon Musk, which accounts for a third of the billionaires wealth, is also vulnerable if relations with China worsen. That country is the companys second-largest market after the United States and it produces more cars there than anywhere else. Tesla has built largely self-sufficient supply chains in the United States and China, a rarity in a world of interconnected trade. As a result, the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods, and the continuing threat to put them on Mexican and Canadian products, might help Tesla by hurting its competitors more. Although there is no evidence that Mr. Musk is shaping trade policies, the tariffs are one of several measures adopted by the Trump administration that may benefit Tesla at the expense of its rivals. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump paused 25 percent tariffs on most autos and parts made in Canada and Mexico, but the reprieve expires in a month, leaving automakers in the United States that depend on foreign supply chains in a state of uncertainty. The administration is also trying to eliminate financial support for the construction of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles, a move that could handicap companies seeking to compete with Teslas extensive network. And it is attempting to cut or eliminate loans and subsidies that competitors like Ford Motor and Rivian are using to finance electric vehicle and battery factories.

China Hits Canada With Tariffs in Indirect Riposte to Trump,"China announced tariffs of up to 100 percent on canola, pork and other foods from Canada on Saturday, in retaliation for Canadas decision last August to collect steep taxes on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, steel and aluminum. The Chinese tariffs, which take effect on March 20, were also a clear warning to Canada  and, indirectly, Mexico  not to cooperate with the United States on trade. The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has been demanding that Canada and Mexico not serve as back doors for low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. market under North American free trade agreements. Chinas State Council Tariff Commission announced on Saturday that it would impose tariffs of 100 percent on canola oil and canola meal, which are among Canadas largest exports to China, and on peas; and 25 percent on Canadian pork and seafood. The commission said the measures were in response to Canadas 100 percent tariffs on electric cars from China and its 25 percent tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, which took effect in October. Chinas Ministry of Commerce said in a separate statement that China urges Canada to immediately correct its wrong practices, lift restrictive measures and eliminate adverse effects. The Canadian government had no immediate comment. The Chinese agencies statements were carefully worded to comply with World Trade Organization rules and did not mention any effort to influence Canada or Mexico during their current trade discussions with the United States. But a commentary released by Chinas state television left little doubt that a key goal for China is dissuading officials in Ottawa and Mexico City from acceding to American pressure for higher Canadian and Mexican tariffs on Chinese goods. The Chinese tariffs are a powerful countermeasure to Canadas wrong choice, and a strong warning to some countries that intend to impose additional tariffs on China in exchange for the United States not to impose additional tariffs on them, China Central Television said.

Trump Seeks to Bar Student Loan Relief to Workers Aiding Migrants and Trans Kids,"President Trump signed an executive order instructing administration officials to alter a student loan forgiveness program for public servants to exclude nonprofit organizations that engage in activities that have what he called a substantial illegal purpose. His order to restrict the program appears to target groups supporting undocumented immigrants, diversity initiatives or gender-affirming care for children, among others, as the Trump administration has sought to eliminate federal support for efforts that have drawn right-wing ire. The order, made public on Friday, is the latest of many attempts to overhaul the loan forgiveness program, which has often whipsawed borrowers with rule changes and bureaucratic obstacles. The program, known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, was created by Congress in 2007 and cannot be eliminated without congressional action, but the Education Department has some leeway to determine how it operates. Mr. Trumps executive order directed the secretaries of education and the Treasury to amend the program to exclude workers for organizations supporting illegal actions, listing several categories of examples, including aiding or abetting violations of federal immigration law. The Trump administration has taken a broad view of what it considers to be support of illegal activities. The order cited as examples organizations that support illegal discrimination, which the administration has previously said includes diversity and inclusion initiatives. The order appeared to target groups supporting gender-affirming care. It said it would exclude from the loan forgiveness program any organization supporting child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.

U.S. Investigates Egg Producers Over Soaring Prices,"The Justice Department is in the early stages of investigating major egg producers in the United States over possible antitrust violations as the price of eggs skyrockets, two people familiar with the matter said. The departments lawyers are preparing to send civil investigative demands  effectively subpoenas for civil investigations  to several producers, including Cal-Maine Foods and Rose Acre Farms, one of the people said. Investigators are looking at whether the companies are sharing sensitive information about pricing and supply, contributing to a spike in prices. The inquiry is being run out of the antitrust divisions Chicago office, the people said. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation. Cal-Maine and Rose Acre did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The Capitol Forum earlier reported the inquiry. Egg prices began soaring last year, and they quickly became an issue in the presidential campaign. Producers have blamed the spread of avian flu, which has forced them to cull millions of hens, for tighter egg supplies and prices that have surpassed 8 a dozen in some areas. The Justice Departments inquiry may not lead to a lawsuit. Some lawmakers and advocacy groups previously called for federal regulators to investigate the industrys pricing practices. Roughly 15 percent of the countrys egg-laying chickens have been killed in the past four months, while wholesale egg prices have risen 255 percent, according to data from Expana, which tracks the prices of eggs.

"At Crypto Summit, Trump Says U.S. Will Be ‘the Bitcoin Superpower’","Sitting beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, more than two dozen of the most powerful figures in the U.S. cryptocurrency industry, together worth many billions of dollars, gathered in the White House on Friday for an audience with President Trump. When Mr. Trump entered the ornate State Dining Room after a short wait, the executives rose to applaud him. Many of you have been fighting for years for this, Mr. Trump said as the room quieted. Its an honor to be with you at the White House. Mr. Trump was holding a first-of-its-kind crypto summit, meeting face to face with the leaders of virtually all of the top crypto companies in the United States. Only a small portion of the gathering, which was scheduled to last four hours, was broadcast to the public. But it offered a vivid illustration of Mr. Trumps recent embrace of crypto, a renegade industry that has spent years battling with U.S. regulators. Several executives, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, offered words of gratitude to Mr. Trump. They called him wonderful, saying they were overjoyed with his approach. High I.Q. individuals around this table, Mr. Trump responded. Since he took office, Mr. Trump has orchestrated a complete transformation of federal policy on crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission has almost entirely reversed an aggressive campaign by the Biden administration to crack down on the industry. The agency, moving with astonishing speed, has issued legal guidance to help crypto companies, ended investigations into major firms and dropped lawsuits against two of the largest exchanges, Coinbase and Kraken.

Trump’s Delay on Mexico and Canada Tariffs Came in Response to Market Revolt,"A month ago, President Trump announced that he would impose sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico before reaching a last-minute deal to delay them for 30 days. This week, after markets revolted when the tariffs were put in place, Mr. Trump watered them down with a monthlong reprieve for automakers. And then on Thursday, he opened up even broader exemptions for many other products that are imported from Americas neighbors to the north and south after intense lobbying from business groups that warned of rising prices. Mr. Trump has spent the last month or so bouncing between imposing sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and delaying them because of last-minute deals. There will, he said, always be changes and adjustments. Despite Mr. Trumps insistence that tariff is among his favorite words, the waffling over import duties reflects the reality that steep import taxes are not an antidote for every policy problem facing the nation. Mr. Trumps economic advisers continue to contend that the tariffs are part of a broader agenda that will not damage the economy. However, the delays and loopholes reveal that they are beginning to see the risks of taking tariffs too far at a time when the economy is showing signs of strain and consumers are still reeling from inflation.

Sam Bankman-Fried Lobbies Trump Associates in Hopes of a Pardon,"Consulting with a lawyer who has ties to President Trump. Reaching out to Washington lobbyists. And sitting for a jailhouse interview with Tucker Carlson. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency mogul who was once a top Democratic donor, has embarked on a long-shot campaign to secure a pardon from the Trump administration, six people with knowledge of the matter said. The effort has been driven by a small group of Mr. Bankman-Frieds supporters, including his parents, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, who are trying to help their son escape the 25-year prison sentence he received after he was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in the collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX. There is no indication that the Bankman-Frieds and their allies have reached Mr. Trump directly or discussed a potential pardon with his White House advisers. But the push appears intended to capitalize on Mr. Trumps transactional approach to clemency. The president has favored pardon seekers with connections to him  either personally or through lawyers and lobbyists  and claims of prosecutorial misconduct that echo his own grievances about the cases against him. As part of the clemency effort, Mr. Bankman and Ms. Fried, who are Stanford University law professors and longtime active Democrats, are consulting with Kory Langhofer, an Arizona lawyer who worked for Mr. Trumps 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. Politically connected businesspeople and Washington lobbyists have also received outreach from intermediaries who claim to be allies of Mr. Bankman-Fried, three people with knowledge of the situation said.

Trump Organization Sues Capital One for Closing Its Accounts,"President Trumps family business sued Capital One on Friday for unjustifiably terminating more than 300 of its bank accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the latest sign that the president and his allies are seeking retribution against those who once shunned them. In a complaint filed in state court in Florida, the Trump Organization accused the bank of arbitrarily closing its accounts in June 2021 in violation of various consumer protection laws. The accounts held millions of dollars at the time, according to the lawsuit. By filing this lawsuit, we seek to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods, the company said in a statement. The bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, did not provide a reason at the time for closing the accounts, the lawsuit said. But in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when Mr. Trumps supporters stormed the Capitol, a number of financial institutions cut ties with his familys real estate business. The groups lawsuit against Capital One could portend similar actions against other banks. More to come, Eric Trump, one of the plaintiffs and the leader of the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Friday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Intuitive Machines Athena Moon Lander Dies After Toppling Over,"A day after landing on the moon, the robotic Athena spacecraft built by Intuitive Machines of Houston is dead. In an update on its website on Friday, the company confirmed that Athena had tipped onto its side  the same fate that befell its first lunar lander, Odysseus, last year. With its solar panels unable to face the sun, the spacecrafts batteries could not recharge. The company said it did not expect the spacecraft to revive. Before the spacecraft fell silent, it said mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones. On Friday afternoon, NASA reported that some of its payloads were able to turn on and send back data before the lander stopped working. The mission was supposed to last 10 days until the darkness of lunar night fell over that part of the moon. The mission was part of a NASA program known as Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, to contract private companies to carry science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon at a lower cost. Another robotic spacecraft that is part of CLPS, the Blue Ghost lander by Firefly Aerospace of Cedar Park, Texas, touched down on Sunday and is conducting science experiments on another part of the moon. Athena landed on Thursday on a flat-topped mountain named Mons Mouton, about 100 miles from the moons south pole. It was the southernmost landing site of any spacecraft.

Powell Says the Fed Is in No Hurry to Adjust Rates Amid Trump Policy Uncertainty,"Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said the central bank is focused on the net effect of President Trumps sweeping economic agenda amid high uncertainty about which policies will actually be enacted, as he reiterated that officials are still not in a hurry to adjust interest rates. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves, Mr. Powell said at an event on Friday. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity. If inflation stays sticky but the economy remains strong, the Fed chair said the central bank can maintain policy restraint for longer. But if either the labor market were to weaken more than expected, or inflation were to rapidly decline, Mr. Powell said officials can ease policy accordingly. His comments underscore the delicate balancing act that Fed is trying to navigate at a tenuous moment for the economy. In an interview on Friday, Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed and a voting member on this years policy-setting committee, warned that a situation in which inflation stayed sticky while growth deteriorated at the same time would be a harder problem for the Fed to solve and something that is increasingly on the radar screen as a result of the policies that Mr. Trump is pursuing. Tariffs on intermediate goods are a negative supply shock, he said, referring to goods that are used to make other products and services for consumers. If there were large negative supply shocks that were to hit the economy, they would have a tendency to both drive down employment and drive up prices.

France’s Ex-Intelligence Chief Convicted in Influence Peddling Trial Involving LVMH,"A Paris court on Friday found Frances former intelligence chief, Bernard Squarcini, guilty of using public resources to benefit the French luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in a trial that shed light on how the company sought to shield its public image for years. Mr. Squarcini, who oversaw Frances spy agency from 2008 to 2012, was hired as a security consultant by LVMH upon leaving his government post. The court ruled that he had abused his power several times to assist the company. It gave him a four-year prison sentence, with two years under house arrest and two years suspended, and ordered him to pay a fine of 200,000 euros, or about 217,000 dollars. His lawyer said he would appeal the ruling. Among other things, the court found Mr. Squarcini complicit in a bizarre illegal surveillance operation that LVMH conducted on François Ruffin, a gadfly French journalist who began making an unflattering documentary in 2012 about the company and its chief executive, the French billionaire Bernard Arnault. Though the company was not among the defendants, the two-week trial took an unexpected turn in November when the head judge requested Mr. Arnault to testify as a witness. In the packed Paris courtroom, the corporate magnate portrayed himself as a successful business leader who had labored to turn LVMH into the worlds top luxury conglomerate, with 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton and Dior, and 200,000 employees worldwide. When Mr. Arnault first took over the company in the 1980s, it had just 10,000 employees. He denied ever knowing of any illegal surveillance. Mr. Squarcini was tried alongside nine other defendants  mostly civil servants, police officers and consultants. Two of them were found not guilty.

"Buying a Home? Without the CFPB, You Need to Be Your Own Watchdog.","House prices are stubbornly high, and mortgage rates remain substantially above their prepandemic level. Now, with the spring home buying season looming, shoppers have a new worry: A major federal consumer watchdog has been hobbled. Without the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency responsible for overseeing most aspects of the home buying process, consumer advocates say home buyers need to be their own watchdogs. Now, when you buy a house, you are much more vulnerable to being misled, said Sharon Cornelissen, housing director with the Consumer Federation of America. Its important to be on guard, because guardrails are being taken away. Buying a home is the biggest financial decision most Americans will make in their lives. The typical home price is about 397,000, according to the National Association of Realtors, but prices are far higher in some parts of the country. In several California counties, for instance, the median price at the end of last year was over 1.5 million, with monthly mortgage payments over 8,000. The consumer bureau was created after the financial and housing crisis in 2007-8 to streamline oversight of lenders and financial companies serving consumers. Over the years, the bureau has moved to ease the mortgage shopping process by offering simplified forms and educational tools, and has taken action against an array of banks and lenders. In 2022, for instance, the bureau ordered Wells Fargo to pay 3.7 billion for mishandling a variety of customer accounts, including improperly denying thousands of requests for mortgage loan modifications that in some cases led borrowers to lose their homes to wrongful foreclosures. On Jan. 17, in the final days of the Biden administration, the bureau reached a settlement with Draper and Kramer Mortgage Corporation for discouraging borrowers from applying for loans to buy homes in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago and Boston. In an email, the lenders lawyers said Draper and Kramer considers the matter closed and denies the bureaus claims, but chose to settle in part to avoid protracted legal costs.

A Tariff Tantrum: the Upheaval from Trump’s Trade Policies,"The markets have spoken. The SP 500 is on track for its worst weekly loss since the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank crisis two years ago. And investors have wiped out post-Election Day gains as President Trumps dizzying start-stop tariff policy fuels volatility on trading floors and in boardrooms. Another test comes this morning with the jobs report due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Its expected to show solid growth in hiring even as federal workers brace for mass layoffs. Economic alarm bells are ringing elsewhere. Mohamed El-Erian and Ed Yardeni, two longtime market watchers, see a downturn in the making, with Yardeni warning of a tariff-induced recession. Those jitters are colliding with concerns about shifting White House policy. Maximalist moves  freezing funding, axing government jobs, engaging in a trade war  that get rolled back have made it tough for world leaders and corporate chiefs to decipher Trumps end game. Jim Farley, Fords C.E.O., sees only costs and chaos from tariffs. A recap: Trump yesterday gave Mexico and Canada a partial tariff reprieve  exempting levies for one month on products covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade pact Trump signed in his first term. Presumably, that buys time to negotiate a truce, though Trump and his trade team have signaled theyre not willing to budge much. Traders still hit the sell button. Trump, who has long cited stock market rallies as a sign his policies are working, blamed globalists for tanking stocks. Im not even looking at the market, because long term the United States will be very strong with what is happening here, he told reporters in the Oval Office yesterday. Tariffs and tensions are up. Trumps levies on aluminum and steel are to go into effect next week, and next month could bring tariffs on agricultural products and automobiles. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada upped the ante, announcing countermeasures on U.S. imports and ominously predicting: We will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future.

"Jobs Report Is Steady, but Impact of Federal Cutbacks and Tariffs Looms","It might be a moment of hush before chaos ensues, or it may be business as usual. U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in February, the first full month under the new Trump administration, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The gain extended a streak of job growth to 50 months. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly, to 4.1 percent, from 4 percent in January. The report showed a decline of 10,000 in federal employment. But it was based on surveys conducted in the second week of February, as the Trump administrations mass firings, buyouts and hiring freezes at federal agencies were still unfolding. The survey has likely not registered more than a sliver of the full impact from federal government layoffs, said Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar. That should change in next months job report. The monthly change in federal government jobs. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By The New York Times A similar waiting game is in store for those hoping to ascertain the effects that President Trumps tariffs  those imposed and those still threatened  may have on global trading partners, business investment and employment. Even without the shake-up in foreign trade and federal employment, private-sector hiring has slowed substantially from the blowout pace of 2021 to 2023. That has left labor market analysts and financial commentators gearing up for a potential cooling in economic growth this year.

Private Prisons Are Ramping Up Detention of Immigrants and Cashing In,"Damon Hininger, the chief executive of CoreCivic, which operates private prisons and immigrant detention centers, opened an investor call last month on a buoyant note. Ive worked at CoreCivic for 32 years, and this is truly one of the most exciting periods in my career, he said, adding that the company was anticipating in the next several years perhaps the most significant growth in our companys history. CoreCivic, GEO Group and some smaller private prison companies are becoming a key cog in the Trump administrations plan to hold and then deport vast numbers of undocumented immigrants. Already in the past week, CoreCivic and GEO have announced new contracts and executives say they are expecting more. GEO Group CoreCivic Other private Public Avg. daily pop.

Trish Costello is Harnessing the Financial Power of Women,"This article is part of a Women and Leadership special report highlighting women who are charting new pathways and fighting for opportunities for women and others. Last year, 178 billion in venture capital was invested in U.S. companies, but only 19 percent of those investment decisions were made by women, according to the capital markets database Pitchbook. Just two percent of that funding went to companies founded by women. This imbalance  which has persisted for decades  is what motivated Trish Costello to start Portfolia in 2014, a venture capital investment platform geared toward women and one of the first venture firms in the U.S. to focus on womens health. That year, only six percent of decision makers at venture capital firms were women. Ms. Costello was part of a small team that founded the Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership at the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City in 1994, and she launched and led Kauffman Fellows, a training program for leaders in venture capital, for many years. The venture capitalists she knew  mostly men  wouldnt even consider backing companies focused on problems like infertility or hot flashes. But Ms. Costello recognized the market potential and was right; from 2018 to 2023, investment in companies that support womens health (many women-led) increased 314 percent in the U.S. and Europe. Ms. Costello said Portfolia has 14 funds that invest in companies with a largely female target market in categories ranging from active aging to longevity to femtech; 90 percent of its investors are women. The firm has made 185 investments valued at more than 65 million in 118 companies. Nearly 70 percent of those are women-led ventures. Ms. Costello, 68, has been an entrepreneur since she was a child growing up in rural Kansas. She and her three siblings were taught early that when faced with a need, they should reframe it as an opportunity. There isnt a time I can remember when I didnt believe that if I came up with a good idea, I could make it happen, she said in a video interview. The conversation was edited and condensed. How did you come to be focused on startup investment and especially in womens health companies? I have always been interested in money as fuel for innovation. Startup investing is about being able to identify the most promising opportunities and get the fuel in at the right time. When I left Kauffman Fellows, I felt like we had made a real shift to more women in venture capital investing. I had been doing some angel investing on my own and saw the market for womens health emerging, and it felt like no one else was seeing the opportunity. I remember I took two deals to V.C.s, companies focused on menopause. One guy said, Theres no way my partners are going to do a menopause deal. Back then, talking about anything related to womens health wasnt done. But I saw a lot of potential in these markets where women were the key customers, influencers and entrepreneurs.

Bringing Diverse Voices to Book Publishing,"This article is part of a Women and Leadership special report highlighting women who are charting new pathways and fighting for opportunities for women and others. When Sally Kim started in the publishing industry more than 30 years ago, in her experience, only editors could sit at the table, she said. The assistants would stand behind them, listening. I remember pitching a book I wanted to buy in a meeting where I wasnt allowed to speak, she said. I was too junior. They were doing me a favor. Ms. Kim isnt silent anymore. Nor is she standing behind anyone. Her seat is at the head of the table, as president and publisher of Little, Brown and Company, one of the oldest publishers in the United States, which consists of six imprints and falls under the Hachette Book Group umbrella. A Korean American whose parents immigrated to the United States, Ms. Kim is the companys first Asian American woman to hold that position. Previously, she was senior vice president and publisher at G.P. Putnams Sons. She said she had spent the past year at Little, Brown and Company inviting everyone, regardless of their position, to pull up a chair and find a seat at the table. Giving everyone a voice is a priority, Ms. Kim, 51, said, so is reading projects together, weighing in and sharing their perspectives. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A Lebanese Woman Fights for Women’s Rights in the Middle East,"This article is part of a Women and Leadership special report highlighting women who are charting new pathways and fighting for opportunities for women and others. Growing up in Beirut, Lebanon, Lina Abou-Habib regularly faced discrimination because of her gender and witnessed inequality for women, she said. People think of Lebanon as a contemporary, open country, but there are many laws that discriminate against women, she said. As an example, women who seek divorces, even if they are in abusive marriages, risk losing custody of their children. In Lebanon, family law is governed by religious courts, and often favors fathers in custody disputes. Ive had more than one friend who is being physically abused by her husband but is too afraid to leave for fear of never seeing her children again, Ms. Abou-Habib said. She also pointed to Lebanons nationality law. Ms. Abou-Habib, 62, the director of the Asfari Institute for Civil Society and Citizenship at the American University of Beirut, where she also teaches, has made it her lifes mission to change the 1925 law, which states that childrens citizenship is based on the nationality of their father, even if their mother is Lebanese. That means if a Lebanese woman marries a man from another country, their children are not considered Lebanese citizens, and must apply for legal residency. They will forever be viewed as aliens in the country of their mothers, Ms. Abou-Habib said. They dont have the right to attend public schools, take a government job or vote. Ms. Abou-Habib has lived through the experience firsthand. Her husband is from a neighboring Arab country, and their Beirut-born daughter will never legally be a Lebanese citizen. The Asfari Institute researches social justice movements in the region, including in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Morocco, and connects activists with academia to collaborate on social change. It also regularly partners with U.N. Women on research projects. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Can an A.I. Travel Bot Plan Your Trip to NYC?,"A Friday evening matinee? To quote the Gershwins, it aint necessarily so. But thats how modern artificial intelligence suggested I hit Broadway. When I was asked to see what A.I. gets right and wrong about visiting New York City, I was deeply curious and felt well qualified for the assignment  Ive been a resident of Manhattan since 1989, a frequent city tour guide for friends and family, and a journalist who has written about technology (including chatbots) since the 1990s. I sampled several A.I.-planner sites with the same vacation request: Create an itinerary for a trip for two people to New York City from April 17 to 20 that suggests an affordable hotel (less than 250 a night) in the middle of the city, several iconic landmarks or museums, a matinee performance of an award-winning Broadway show and a great pizza stop. I asked for directions for accessible ways to get to each place from the hotel, and then made additional requests for suggestions if children were coming along. While most of the sites offered many of the same classic New York spots, like the Museum of Modern Art, the user experience varied. (Note that all the sampled sites use OpenAIs software in some way and The Times has an active copyright-infringement lawsuit against OpenAI.) If you are new to the world of A.I. travel planners, here are a few that may appeal to certain types of human travel planners. With its energetic home page full of photos and features, Mindtrip (free) felt like the most welcoming A.I. planner for a newcomer. Its initial itinerary hit most of the top tourist stops, like the Statue of Liberty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Central Park, with links to the sites suggested highlights. Mindtrip also suggested the Pod 51 hotel on East 51st Street (about 303 a night), which is a great location, but rooms in the Pod chain aim for chic minimalist, which may not be for everyone, particularly families.

Trump’s Tariffs by Whim Keep Allies and Markets Off Balance,"On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick went on Fox Business to reassure nervous allies and even more twitchy investors that the Trump administration was negotiating a deal to avoid tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, and that the president is gonna work something out with them. Its not going to be a pause for Mr. Trumps on-again, off-again tariffs, he insisted. None of that pause stuff. On Thursday, the world got what the president characterized as more of that pause stuff. Mr. Trumps announcement that he had a good conversation with Mexicos president, and would delay most tariffs until April 2, was only the latest example of the punish-by-whim nature of the second Trump presidency. A few hours after the Mexico announcement, Canada got a break too, even as Mr. Trump on social media accused its departing prime minister, Justin Trudeau, of using the Tariff problem to run again for Prime Minister. So much fun to watch! he wrote. Indeed, it appears that Mr. Trump is having enormous fun turning tariffs on and off like tap water. But others are developing a case of Trump-induced whiplash, not least investors, who sent stock prices down again on Thursday amid the uncertainty over what Mr. Trumps inconstancy means for the global economy. When the White House finally released the text of Mr. Trumps orders on Thursday evening, it appeared that some of the tariffs  those covered in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that Mr. Trump negotiated and celebrated in his first term  were indeed permanently suspended. Other tariffs were merely paused. Most everyone involved was confused, which may well have been the point. As Mr. Trump hands down tariff determinations and then pulls them back for a month or so, world leaders call to plead their case, a bit like vassal states appealing to a larger power. Chief executives put in calls as well, making it clear that Mr. Trump is the one you need to deal with if you are bringing in car parts from Canada or chips from China.

"A Cheeto Shaped Like the Pokemon Charizard Sells for Nearly $90,000","Jordan Tkacsik was perusing his friend Paul Bartletts sports memorabilia and trading card shop last year when he noticed something unusual in a section full of Pokémon collectibles. It was a Cheetos cheese puff, but not just any Cheeto. Rather, it was a Flamin Hot Cheeto that bore an uncanny resemblance to Charizard, an orange dragon-like creature that is one of the Pokémon universes original and most beloved characters. The Cheeto itself was housed in a small plastic container  It sort of looked like a travel-size Q-Tip case, Mr. Tkacsik said  and the three-inch cheesy treat even had a name: Cheetozard. Mr. Tkacsik was not exactly a Pokémon aficionado, but he knew it was an unusual item. He could also sense that it was important to Mr. Bartlett, the owner of 1st and Goal Collectibles in Canton, Ga. So Mr. Tkacsik offered to design and build an improved case for Cheetozard. I sort of made it my mission to see if I could do it, he said. Still, Mr. Tkacsik had no way of knowing that Cheetozard was bound for global celebrity. On Sunday, the dragon-shaped snack sold at auction for 72,000 (plus fees that pushed the price to nearly 90,000) amid a bidding frenzy. Goldin Auctions, which sold the Cheeto, declined to disclose the buyers and sellers identities, citing client confidentiality. But at a time when a banana taped to a wall can fetch 6.2 million, a Pokémon-themed Cheeto selling for a mere five figures might be considered a bargain.

SpaceX’s Starship Rocket Disrupts Florida Airports With Unsuccessful Test Flight,"Starship  the huge spacecraft that Elon Musk says will one day take people to Mars  failed during its latest test flight on Thursday when its upper stage exploded in space, raining debris and disrupting air traffic at airports from Florida to Pennsylvania. It was the second consecutive test flight of the most powerful rocket ever built where the upper-stage spacecraft malfunctioned. It started spinning out of control after several engines went out and then lost contact with mission control. Photographs and videos posted on the social media site X by users saying they were along the Florida coast showed the spacecraft breaking up. The falling debris disrupted flights at airports in Miami, Orlando, Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, and as far away as Philadelphia International Airport. The Starship rocket system is the largest ever built. At 403 feet tall, it is nearly 100 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty atop its pedestal. It has the most engines ever in a rocket booster: The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 of SpaceXs Raptor engines. As those engines lift Starship off the launchpad, they will generate 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle. The upper part, also called Starship or Ship for short, looks like a shiny stainless steel rocket from science fiction movies of the 1950s. This is the upper stage that will head toward orbit, and ultimately could carry people to the moon or even Mars. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Stocks Tumble as Trump Pauses Mexico and Canada Tariffs Again,"Stocks tumbled on Thursday, adding to a string of recent losses, even after the Trump administration offered a reprieve on tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The SP 500 dropped 1.8 percent, taking the slide for the index this week to 3.6 percent and putting it on course for its worst week since a banking crisis two years ago that felled some of the countrys small lenders. Mr. Trump had imposed tariffs of 25 percent on imports from Mexico and Canada on Tuesday. He also raised tariffs on imports from China. Investors are concerned that the tariffs  and retaliation from the other countries  will fuel inflation, slow economic growth and hurt American businesses. After sliding 3 percent over Monday and Tuesday, the SP 500 staged a small recovery on Wednesday as the big tech stocks that have driven the market in recent years bounced and investors grew hopeful for some reprieve on tariffs. But the administrations move to exempt auto manufacturing, along with products already part of a previous trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada, until April failed to settle investors concerns about the impact on the economy. The SP 500 is now almost 7 percent below a record set just over three weeks ago, which means it is close to falling into correction, defined as a sell-off of 10 percent or more from a recent peak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies that are typically more exposed to the economy, are both already in correction.",Business,rss.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/business/stock-market-today.html,2025-03-08
Senators Press Marty Makary on Abortion Pills and Vaccines,"At a confirmation hearing for Dr. Marty Makary on Thursday, senators focused heavily on the safety of the abortion pill, with Republican lawmakers urging him to restrict access and Democratic lawmakers demanding that he maintain its current availability. Dr. Makary, President Trumps nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, signaled that he shared Republicans concerns about the current policy, issued during the Biden administration, which expanded access by allowing people to obtain the pills without an in-person medical appointment. Several Democrats pointed to volumes of studies showing that the drugs are safe. Dr. Makary told members of the Senate health committee, which held the hearing, that he would review the pills safety and the policy at issue. He said he would take a solid, hard look at the data and to meet with the professional career scientists who have reviewed the data at the F.D.A. and to build an expert coalition to review the ongoing data, which is required to be collected. The hearing also touched on vaccines, with several lawmakers, including the committee chairman, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, questioning why an advisory committee meeting on next years flu vaccine had been canceled in recent weeks and asking whether it would be held later. He and others stressed that the flu panel met annually, and some reminded Dr. Makary that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees the F.D.A. as health secretary, had pledged transparency in agency decision-making. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, called the cancellation unprecedented and dangerous after decades of annual meetings. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Sweeping Tariffs Threaten to Undo a 30-Year Trade Alliance,"When the United States signed a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico more than 30 years ago, the premise was that partnering with two other thriving economies would also benefit America. This week, President Trump abruptly scrapped that idea. He imposed a sweeping 25 percent tariff on Tuesday on the roughly 1 trillion of imports that Mexico and Canada send into the United States each year as part of that North American trade pact  before quickly walking them back. On Thursday, the president signed executive orders suspending the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for goods that trade under the rules of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is much of the trade that crosses North American borders. If the tariffs had been maintained, they would have significantly raised costs for Canadian and Mexican exports, undermining their economies and likely tipping them into recession. Mr. Trumps flirtation this week with unwinding decades of economic integration raises big questions about the future of North America and the industries that have been built around the idea of an economically integrated continent. While some factories in Canada and Mexico might have moved to the United States to avoid tariffs, the levies would also have raised costs for American consumers and manufacturers that have come to depend on materials from their North American neighbors. This is a day where the United States stopped seeing trade as force for mutual benefit, and began seeing it as a tool of economic warfare, said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He added that the levies were a fundamental attack on the economic well being of our closest neighbors. While Mr. Trump suspended his tariffs on Thursday, any relief could be short lived. The president has said that he expects to issue more tariffs on Canada and Mexico next month, when he announces what he is calling reciprocal tariff measures.

"Intuitive Machines’ Athena Lander Is on the Moon, but Its Fate Is Unclear","Athena didnt crash. But what did happen to it? Hours after the 15-foot-tall robotic spacecraft arrived at the moons surface, closer to the lunar south pole than any spacecraft has been, it remained unclear whether its touchdown was smooth enough to perform its intended work, or if it toppled over in the process, potentially limiting the missions scientific achievements. Were trying to evaluate exactly what happened in that last bit, Tim Crain, the chief technology officer of Intuitive Machines, said at a news conference. The spacecraft is almost identical to Odysseus, the lander that the company sent to the moon last year. Odysseus was the first commercially operated vehicle to successfully land on the moon. But that success came with an asterisk when the vehicle toppled shortly after reaching the ground. It appears that might have happened again. At a post-landing news conference, Steve Altemus, the chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said the spacecraft had sent back conflicting data about whether it was standing upright or tipped over. But a sensor known as an inertial measurement unit offered a perhaps convincing clue that Athena was on its side. As it headed to the lunar surface, laser instruments that measured the landers altitude were providing noisy data, which may have contributed to the botched landing. Until that final descent, Athena had performed much more smoothly than the Odysseus lander a year ago, said Dr. Crain of Intuitive Machines. We were expecting a fully successful landing, he said.

"E.C.B. Cuts Interest Rates Again, With an Uncertain Path Ahead","The European Central Bank lowered interest rates on Thursday, the sixth consecutive cut, as the economic landscape for the region rapidly changes. The banks key rate was cut by a quarter point to 2.5 percent, which was widely expected as inflation in the region has stayed relatively low and economic growth has been weak. But the future path of interest rates has become increasingly uncertain as policymakers face a seismic shift in Europe. In the past few days, European leaders have vowed to increase military spending by hundreds of billions of euros as they are no longer sure of their alliances with the United States. A decade and a half of strict fiscal constraint in Germany is being broken as the countrys next government is planning to ease borrowing rules to allow more spending on defense and infrastructure. On Thursday, Christine Lagarde, the president of the central bank, emphasized the whirlwind pace of economic and political change taking place in Europe. We have not been spared recent developments in the last few hours and days, she said at a news conference in Frankfurt. Ms. Lagarde said policymakers would be attentive and vigilant to those spending plans to determine the effect on inflation. But she added that officials at the bank expected the additional spending to add to economic growth. She added that policymakers were keenly following developments in Brussels on Thursday, as European leaders gathered to negotiate defense plans. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Who’s Got Trump’s Ear on Tariffs? Lutnick or Navarro?,"President Trumps tariff policy has given corporate chiefs and investors a serious case of whiplash. While the markets cheered on Wednesdays delay on auto sector levies, setting off an impressive late-day rally, the move also adds to the confusion about what comes next. The latest: Theres increasing buzz that agricultural products are next in line for tariff relief, as the president faces intense lobbying from his party. And the release on Wednesday of the Feds beige book survey of regional activity showed that companies were growing worried that the levies would push up prices. One school of thought on Trumps tariff plans: they could level the field before negotiations. Trump himself sees them as a tool to bolster the U.S. economy. A way to think about this is to look at the people in his orbit. On tariffs, there are two key, and seemingly polar opposite, figures. Theres Howard Lutnick, the former head of Cantor Fitzgerald who is a moderate on trade and now commerce secretary. And there is Peter Navarro, a longtime Trump lieutenant and a proponent of high tariffs who is generally opposed to trade deals. Who has more influence? For now, it seems to be Lutnick. Trumps announcement of a one-month pause on tariffs on cars coming through Canada and Mexico wouldnt have surprised anyone who heard Lutnicks comments earlier in the day.

Macy’s Signals Rocky Year Ahead as Retailers Reckon With Trade War,"Macys, the largest department store in the United States, saw slightly improved sales during the holiday season, but it and other retailers have warned of a rocky year ahead as tariffs push up prices and sow uncertainty for shoppers. Macys said on Thursday that comparable sales across all of its stores, which include Bloomingdales and Bluemercury, rose 0.2 percent last quarter, its best result in nearly three years. Although a modest improvement, the result was welcomed as the retailer faces many challenges, including consumers squeezed by inflation, shrinking margins and a bizarre accounting error. Macys is in the midst of a turnaround plan that includes closing underperforming locations: It has closed more than 60 of 150 planned stores so far. Like other retailers, Macys gave a cautious outlook for this year. It expects to bring in less revenue, in part because of the store closures, and for comparable sales to fall as much as 2 percent. The companys shares, which have fallen about 20 percent this year, seesawed in early trading on Thursday. Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consulting firm GlobalData, said that this year would be a choppy one for Macys, but that it was now at least headed in the right direction. Its plans may be derailed by a sweeping round of tariffs recently imposed by President Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico and China  the countrys three largest trading partners  which are looming over retailers.

FDA Nominee Marty Makary to Face Grilling Over Cutbacks and Policy Shifts,"Dr. Marty Makary may face sharp questions from senators about whether he will defend the Food and Drug Administration against staff cutbacks and industry pressure on Thursday, although he is still expected to sail through his confirmation hearing to become the agencys commissioner. Dr. Makary built his reputation as a contrarian in the medical field, gaining widespread notice by speaking out about medical errors. Those close to him have remarked on his willingness to agree with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nations health secretary, on a variety of issues. As a pancreatic cancer surgeon and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Makary has been viewed by some as a study in contrasts. He has written several books criticizing what he considers flaws in medical orthodoxy that result in recommendations backed by scant evidence. Yet he also drew attention from the Trump team as a Fox News personality with more controversial views, like his relatively early predictions that Covid would fade as a concern and that widespread immunity would take hold long before it did. Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine, said that it was not clear which was the true Marty Makary. She said that was an important question, given some of Mr. Kennedys pronouncements. The health secretary has suggested that the F.D.A. should lift constraints on risky products like raw milk, which can be rife with bacteria, and had embraced hydroxychloroquine, a drug briefly used as a Covid therapy before its risks were deemed to exceed any benefit.

Trump’s Cuts to Federal Work Force Push Out Young Employees,"About six months ago, Alex Brunet, a recent Northwestern University graduate, moved to Washington and started a new job at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an honors paralegal. It was fitting for Mr. Brunet, 23, who said he had wanted to work in public service for as long as he could remember and help craft an economy that works better for everyone. But about 15 minutes before he was going to head to dinner with his girlfriend on the night before Valentines Day, an email landed in his inbox informing him that he would be terminated by the end of the day  making him one of many young workers who have been caught up in the Trump administrations rapid wave of firings. Its discouraging to all of us, Mr. Brunet said. Weve lost, for now at least, the opportunity to do something that matters. Among the federal workers whose careers and lives have been upended in recent weeks are those who represent the next generation of civil servants and are now wrestling with whether they can even consider a future in public service. The Trump administrations moves to reduce the size of the bureaucracy have had an outsize impact on these early career workers. Many of them were probationary employees who were in their roles for less than one or two years, and were among the first to be targeted for termination. The administration also ended the Presidential Management Fellows Program, a prestigious two-year training program for recent graduates interested in civil service, and canceled entry-level job offers. The firings of young people across the government could have a long-term effect on the ability to replenish the bureaucracy with those who have cutting-edge skills and knowledge, experts warn. Donald F. Kettl, a former dean in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, says that young workers bring skills the government needs in fields like information technology, medicine and environmental protection.

"Help! I Couldn’t Take My Tall-Ship Voyage, and I Want My Money Back.","Last summer, I booked a five-day sailing trip with Tall Ship Experience, a company based in Spain. For 1,350 euros, or 1,450, I would be a volunteer on the crew of the Atlantis, sailing between two ports in Italy. But eight days before, I had a bad fall that resulted in multiple injuries, including eight stitches to my face that doctors said I could not expose to sun or water. The Tall Ship Experience website clearly states that I could cancel for a full refund up to seven days before the trip. But the company revealed it was just an intermediary and the Dutch organization actually running the trip, Tallship Company, had different rules, under which I was refunded 10 percent. I offered to take credit for a future trip, to no avail. Finally, I disputed the charges with my credit card issuer, American Express. But Tall Ship Experience provided a completely different set of terms to Amex, saying I canceled one day in advance. The charges were reinstated. Can you help? Martha, Los Angeles This story reads like a greatest-hits playlist of travel industry traps: a middleman shirking responsibility, terms and conditions run amok, a credit card chargeback gone wrong, and the maddening barriers to pursuing justice against a foreign company. However, the documentation you sent was so complete and the companys website so confusing that I was sure Tall Ship Experience would quickly refund you. Tallship Company did not respond to requests for comments, but did nothing wrong. It simply followed its own terms and conditions that Tall Ship Experience, as a middleman, should have made clear to you. When you canceled, Tallship Company sent back a 10 percent refund to Tall Ship Experience to then send to you. Thats why I was surprised that the stubborn (though exceedingly polite) Tall Ship Experience spokeswoman who responded to me on behalf of the Seville-based organization argued repeatedly that although she regretted your disappointment, Tall Ship Experience was not at fault. At one point she suggested you should have purchased travel insurance, even as the company scrambled to adjust and update its website as we emailed. Before the changes, the site contained two distinct and contradictory sets of terms and conditions: one for customers who purchased via the websites English and French versions, and another on the Spanish version. (Confusingly, both documents were in Spanish.) The EnglishFrench version  the one you had seen  promised customers a full refund for trips canceled more than seven days in advance. The Spanish one is vastly more complex, offering distinct cancellation terms for each ship. The Atlantis offered customers in your situation only 10 percent back.

"To Create Opportunities for Other Women, Odessa Jenkins Formed Her Own League","This article is part of a Women and Leadership special report highlighting women who are charting new pathways and fighting for opportunities for women and others. In the football world, those who know Odessa Jenkins would say that shes got fire, spunk and the ability to turn things up a notch. Its an apt description for Ms. Jenkins, a native of what was then known as South-Central Los Angeles, who has distinguished herself in the world of female tackle football as a Womens Football Hall of Fame running back, holder of eight world titles and three gold medals from various sports entities, and as head coach for the Texas Elite Spartans. Ms. Jenkins, 44, who now resides in Dallas, was deeply frustrated with the lack of diversity in the male-dominated field of football. Though she found some avenues to play, she was painfully aware that there were not many such opportunities for other women  and those that did exist were not profit-generating and didnt offer economic stability. In 2019 she founded the Womens National Football Conference, W.N.F.C., a for-profit, full-contact womens professional football league whose mission is to foster financial equity for women and girls through the power of football. I wanted women to be recognized as professional football players and to be paid for it, she said. I didnt want to wait another 60 years for that to happen. The league started out with 15 teams across the United States, including the Texas Elite Spartans. Since then, the league has gained three teams. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A Youth Leader From Chile Fights Discrimination Across the Globe,"This article is part of a Women and Leadership special report highlighting women who are charting new pathways and fighting for opportunities for women and others. The first time she encountered discrimination, Isidora Uribe Silva said, she was 12. Up until that point, having cerebral palsy was never a problem from the perspective of others, but when I changed schools, I was bullied by my classmates, said Ms. Uribe Silva, who relies on a walker or cane to get around. My teachers and the school wouldnt accommodate me, and I was increasingly isolated. Ms. Uribe Silva (whose birth name was Isidora Guzmán Silva) said that she ended up leaving and didnt attend school at all for seven months until she found Institución Teresiana in Santiago, Chile, where she still lives, which was willing to accept her with her disability. This experience made me deeply aware of the systemic exclusion that exists, not just for myself but for many other marginalized communities worldwide, said Ms. Uribe Silva, now 20 and a law student at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. She became an advocate for inclusion policies, working to promote equality in Chile and globally, especially for women like her who have disabilities. Ms. Uribe Silva was 13 when she developed an app, Encuentra Tu Lugar (Find Your Place), to help disabled people in Chile find accessible parking spaces. Subsequently, she established a foundation of the same name and broadened her goals. She is a member of the Generation Equality Adolescent Committee of U.N. Women and was selected to be part of the U.N. Women Leaders Network, established during the U.N. General Assemblys annual session in September; the group advocates for gender-equal participation in leadership and in decision-making processes. Ms. Uribe Silva was interviewed by phone and email.

7-Eleven Taps American Executive to Help Keep It Out of Canadian Hands,"Fighting off a takeover by a Canadian rival, the Japanese parent company of 7-Eleven announced a major business shake-up on Thursday that included the appointment of its first foreign-born chief executive. Seven  i Holdings said that Stephen Dacus, 64, a member of the companys board of directors and longtime retail executive from the United States, would take on the role in May. It also said it planned to hold an initial public offering of its U.S. convenience store business, which operates more than 13,000 7-Eleven branches in the country. The moves are the companys latest attempt to prevent itself from being acquired by the retail group Alimentation Couche-Tard, the Canadian owner of the Circle K convenience store chain. That company has offered about 47 billion for control of Seven  i, the largest-ever foreign-led bid for a Japanese company. Japans corporate landscape, which in many ways resisted change for decades, is beginning to shift in the face of an influx of attention from foreign investors. The reshuffling at Seven  i, whose convenience stores are so ubiquitous in Japan that they are considered part of the national infrastructure, is the latest example of that transformation. Activist investors have long pushed Seven  i to spin off its 7-Eleven convenience store business, arguing that doing so would improve the valuation of the sprawling retail group, whose businesses ranged from supermarkets to outlets that sold things like stationery and baby goods.

More Than 36 Million Watched Trump’s Address to Congress on Live TV,"About 36.6 million Americans watched President Trump live on television on Tuesday night, tuning in for his 100-minute speech to a joint session of Congress  the longest of its kind in the modern era. Nielsen, the ratings agency, said the live television audience for Mr. Trumps wide-ranging and often pugilistic address was up 13 percent from former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.s final State of the Union speech a year ago. The annual presidential speech to Congress is one of the last remaining mass-audience media moments available to a national politician. Mr. Trump, a connoisseur of television and a former star of reality TV, moved to take advantage of the large audience, repeatedly taunting the Democrats in the chamber and boasting of a new golden age in the country. Nielsen ratings mostly measure traditional television viewers, leaving out millions of Americans who often follow major news events across a plethora of news websites and some other digital platforms. While Mr. Trumps speech clocked in at record-breaking length, many voters were likely to consume shorter clips of isolated moments circulated on social media and cable news. The Nielsen ratings figure for Tuesdays speech spanned 15 major cable and broadcast networks. The industry has no widely agreed-upon metric to accurately measure online and digital-only views. Fox News, which has extended its ratings dominance in recent months, attracted the largest TV audience of any network on Tuesday, with 10.7 million viewers, according to Nielsen. Among other cable news networks, CNN and MSNBC both drew about 1.9 million viewers. The highest-rated broadcast network was ABC, which attracted about 6.3 million viewers. It was also the top-ranked broadcast network among viewers ages 25 to 54, which is considered the most important demographic for the advertisers in television news. According to Nielsen, about 71 percent of live TV viewers were 55 and older.",Business,rss.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/business/media/trump-speech-ratings.html,2025-03-08
L.A. County Sues Southern California Edison over Eaton Fire,"Los Angeles County sued Southern California Edison and its parent company on Wednesday, blaming the utilitys equipment for causing the deadly Eaton fire in January. The countys lawsuit is the most prominent case brought against Edison, which is also facing scores of lawsuits filed by victims of the fire that killed 17 people and destroyed more than 9,400 buildings near Altadena and Pasadena, Calif. The cities of Pasadena and Sierra Madre are also filing suits against Edison for damages that include the use of taxpayer resources and destruction of public infrastructure during the fire, the county said. We are committed to seeking justice for the Altadena community and the taxpayers of Los Angeles County, Dawyn R. Harrison, counsel for Los Angeles County, said in a statement. The official cause of the Eaton fire remains under investigation by the State Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. An Edison spokeswoman, Kathleen Dunleavy, said the utility had been reviewing the lawsuits and would respond to the complaints in court. Our hearts continue to be with the communities affected by the wildfires, Ms. Dunleavy said. In its lawsuit, Los Angeles County said videos, eyewitness accounts and other evidence made clear that Edison equipment caused the Eaton fire on Jan. 7. Preliminary reviews by fire investigators placed the origin of the fire in Eaton Canyon, where Edison maintains four active and three inactive transmission lines. A gas station video that appeared to show the beginnings of the fire and data that suggest there were electrical faults on Edisons transmission system, both of which were first reported by The New York Times, prompted the utility to expand its own investigation into the cause of the fire. In a letter to state regulators, the utility said it was examining the available evidence and equipment to determine if its equipment might have been involved in starting the fire. Edison also noted in the letter that there might be a connection between its equipment and another fire that started the same day, the Hurst fire in Sylmar. The Eaton and Hurst fires were among several blazes that burned across the Los Angeles area in January as a storm ripped through Southern California with winds reaching as high as 100 m.p.h. In addition to the Eaton fire, 12 people died in the Palisades fire, which devastated the coastal neighborhood of Pacific Palisades. The Palisades fire also remains under investigation.",Business,rss.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/business/energy-environment/la-county-eaton-fire-edison-lawsuit.html,2025-03-08
South Africa’s Play to Ease Tensions With Trump: A New Trade Deal,"South Africa is preparing a new trade offer to present to President Trump, hoping to appeal to his transactional approach to foreign policy and ease boiling tensions with Washington, a spokesman for South Africas president said this week. The spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, said in an interview that South African officials are anticipating Mr. Trump will call for an end to the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a decades-old trade agreement that has been an economic boon to the 32 African nations that it includes. The act allows billions of dollars worth of goods  from produce to cars  from sub-Saharan Africa to enter the United States without duties. It is scheduled to expire this year but could be reauthorized by Congress. Although officials in South Africa hope the program will be renewed, they plan to offer the United States a bilateral deal that would increase trade in sectors such as energy, Mr. Magwenya said. A future without the African Growth and Opportunity Act would represent a significant shift for the continents largest economy. South Africa has for years lobbied against threats to expel it from the program on the grounds that its economy had grown too advanced. South African officials argue that the African Growth and Opportunity Act has kept businesses confident in the South African economy, helped maintain stability across the continent and fostered a healthy relationship with the United States.

Tom Llamas Named Anchor of ‘NBC Nightly News’,"Tom Llamas will take over as the anchor of NBCs flagship news program, NBC Nightly News, the company said on Wednesday. Mr. Llamas, 45, has been the anchor on the companys streaming news outlet, NBC News Now. He succeeds Lester Holt, the longtime anchor of NBC Nightly News, who last month announced his plans to step down from the role. The network said Mr. Llamas would take over NBC Nightly News this summer, assuming a lead anchor job that has been held by only three men  Tom Brokaw, Brian Williams and Mr. Holt  over the past 42 years. Of course, the evening newscast does not have the same agenda-setting influence as it did during Mr. Brokaws tenure. But the newscasts still draw big audiences. Since September, NBC Nightly News has been attracting 6.3 million viewers a night, lagging ABCs World News Tonight but remaining ahead of CBS Evening News. In a statement, Mr. Llamas (pronounced YA-mas) said that taking over the anchoring duties was a profound honor and one that carries tremendous responsibility. During the Nightly News afternoon editorial call on Wednesday, Mr. Holt called in from an Amtrak en route to New York from Washington and offered his congratulations. Its important to make the broadcast his, and you will over time, so well make this transition work, he said, according to a staff member who heard his remarks. But Im happy, happy for Tom and his family  crush it my friend. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Trump Says US Banks Can’t Do Business in Canada. It’s Not That Simple.,"Hours after imposing steep tariffs on Canada, President Trump raised an issue that even the American lenders whose cause hes championing find perplexing: the access, or lack thereof, of U.S. banks to the Canadian market. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, Canada doesnt allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market. He added sarcastically, Oh, that seems fair to me, doesnt it? While this issue doesnt often come up in conversations with prominent American bank executives, it appears to be increasingly on the presidents mind. Mr. Trump mentioned the Canada banking issue early last month as part of a broader criticism against what he views as the unequal economic balance between the United States and its northern neighbor. Writing on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said Canada doesnt even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business. Here is the actual state of play for U.S. banks in Canada: Canadas banking sector is dominated by the Big Six, the half-dozen institutions including the Royal Bank of Canada and TD Bank. They are permitted to take deposits, extend mortgages and advise corporate clients  all the core activities for banks. And Canadian customers disproportionately still prefer to do their banking in person, as opposed to online, meaning it would require a major physical presence for any entrant to attempt to enter the market. Additionally, U.S. banks are restricted in what they can do in Canada. Foreign banks, including American ones, must either work with a Canadian middleman, establish a Canadian subsidiary or receive special government permission to do business. Unless they agree to follow Canadas stringent banking rules that include holding a hefty sum of cash-like assets in reserve at all times, they cannot operate retail branches that take deposits under around 100,000.

Weight Loss Drug Will Be Offered for $499 a Month for Some Patients,"Novo Nordisk will cut the price of its blockbuster weight loss medication Wegovy to 499 per month for certain patients who pay using their own money instead of going through insurance, the drug maker said on Wednesday. The move could cause more patients to start taking the drug. But the impact stands to be limited, because the decision does not lower prices for patients who get their health insurance through government programs or for employers that are struggling with the huge costs of medications like Wegovy, which have revolutionized the treatment of obesity. To be eligible for the reduced price, patients must be uninsured or commercially insured on plans that dont cover the drug. Previously, the drug maker had offered a coupon to such patients allowing them to get a months supply of the drug for 650; Wednesdays move translates into savings of 150 per month for such patients. The new offering is not available to tens of millions of Americans who get their insurance through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid  a demographic that largely lacks insurance coverage for weight loss drugs like Wegovy. To get Novo Nordisks drug, these patients must generally pay 1,300 or more per month out of pocket at a pharmacy. Novo Nordisk will offer the discounted product through an online pharmacy that will send prescriptions to patients through the mail  a strategy that drug makers are increasingly using to take more control of the distribution of their products. Novo Nordisks competitor, Eli Lilly, has a similar offering for vials of its weight loss drug, Zepbound, for 499 per month or less. Novo Nordisks price reduction comes just weeks before the market for cheaper copycat versions of Wegovy is expected to contract substantially. For the past few years, patients seeking lower prices have turned to versions created through a drug-ingredient mixing process known as compounding, which is permitted by regulators when patented products are in short supply. Patients often pay about 150 per month out of pocket for compounded versions of Wegovy. An estimated two million patients got the drug this way over a recent one-year period. But last month the Food and Drug Administration declared the Wegovy shortage over and ordered compounders to wind down their operations by April or May. Novo Nordisk now has the opportunity to scoop up displaced patients who had been relying on compounding and increase sales of its official version of the drug.",Business,rss.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/health/wegovy-price-weight-loss-drugs.html,2025-03-08
"Hackers Stole $635,000 in Taylor Swift Ticket Scheme, Queens D.A. Says","Two people accused of stealing and reselling more than 900 tickets to the Taylor Swift Eras Tour and other marquee events are facing criminal charges for their role in the scheme, New York prosecutors said. Several people were involved in hacking into the computer system of the online ticket-sales platform StubHub starting in the summer of 2022, the Queens district attorney, Melinda Katz, said in a news release on Monday. They then resold the tickets on the same platform for a profit, which added up to 635,000. Tyrone Rose, 20, of Kingston, Jamaica, and Shamara P. Simmons, 31, of the New York City neighborhood of Jamaica, Queens, were arrested and arraigned on Feb. 27 in Criminal Court in Queens. The lawyers listed for them in court documents did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Rose and Ms. Simmons were both charged with second-degree grand larceny, first-degree computer tampering, fourth-degree conspiracy and fourth-degree computer tampering. Mr. Rose worked for an outsourcing company in Kingston, Sutherland Global Services, which was contracted by StubHub, according to the criminal complaint. Mr. Rose and a co-worker, who has not been arrested or publicly identified, used their access to part of StubHubs ticketing system to find a way into a secure part of the network that they were not authorized to use, where information about ticket orders was stored.

Florida Seeks Drug Prescription Data With Names of Patients and Doctors,"Floridas insurance regulator has demanded an unusually intrusive trove of data on millions of prescription drugs filled in the state last year, including the names of patients taking the medications, their dates of birth and doctors theyve seen. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in January sought this information from pharmacy benefit managers like UnitedHealths Optum Rx and CVS Healths Caremark, companies that oversee prescription drugs for employers and government programs. It remained unclear why the state was ordering the submission of so much data. In a letter to one benefit manager reviewed by The New York Times, the regulator said the state required the data to review whether the benefit managers, known as P.B.M.s, were compliant with a 2023 state law aimed at lowering drug prices and reining in the managers. But the demand is sparking concerns about government overreach and patient privacy. You dont need such granular patient information for purposes of oversight, said Sharona Hoffman, a health law and privacy expert at Case Western Reserve University. She added: You have to worry: Is the government actually trying to get information about reproductive care or transgender care or mental health care? Floridas six-week abortion ban, enacted by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, and the states Republican-dominated legislature, requires that doctors who prescribe abortion pills dispense them in person, not through the mail. Another Florida law banned transgender transition care for minors and made it harder for adults to seek such care. Last year, a judge struck down key parts of that law, though it is still being enforced while the legal fight makes its way through the courts. The data requested by the state could, in theory, be used to determine whether physicians are complying with those laws. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Oil Prices Drop Amid Concerns Over Trump’s Tariffs and OPEC Increases,"Oil prices swooned on Wednesday as economic uncertainty rippled through global markets, a reaction to President Trumps tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico and a decision by members of the OPEC Plus oil cartel to begin increasing crude production in April. Since last year, OPEC Plus has signaled its intention to pump more oil, but doing so now in the midst of turbulence from a trade war between the United States and various partners surprised some analysts. Analysts were thinking they would surely defer the increases given the macroeconomic threat from tariffs, said David Fyfe, chief economist of Argus Media, a London commodities research firm. On Wednesday, prices for Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, plummeted about 3.6 percent to 68.50 a barrel, the lowest since 2021. West Texas Intermediate, the American standard, fell more than 4 percent to 65.30 a barrel. In a possible hint of weakening demand, crude oil inventories in the United States rose by a hefty 3.6 million barrels  much more than analysts expected  in the last week of February, according to the Energy Information Administration. Still, these stocks, which are closely watched by the markets, are 4 percent below their five-year averages. Several conflicting trends are influencing oil prices. Oil consumption is highly sensitive to the performance of the world economy, which might slow if the trade war heats up, crimping trade, air travel and other activities. At the same time, several members of OPEC Plus, including the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, want to increase production, partly to fulfill agreements with international investors. The group also includes Saudi Arabia and Russia. The oil-producing countries have ensnared themselves in a complex series of agreements, which analysts say the markets struggle to interpret. But traders fear that the millions of barrels a day of oil currently being held off the market could eventually come back at a time when world oil consumption is growing only modestly. In addition, it is hard to gauge what impact the Trump administrations energy strategy will have on the oil markets. Tighter sanctions on producers like Iran and Venezuela would reduce supplies. But easing regulation of the petroleum industry in the United States might increase oil production. And removing restrictions on Russian energy as part of an effort to achieve a cease-fire in the war in Ukraine could also add to the global supply. According to its announcement on Monday, OPEC Plus will gradually increase output by a total of 2.2 million barrels a day, or roughly 2 percent of global supplies, over a period running well into 2026. The group said Sunday that it could pause or even reverse the increases if conditions warranted. Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a research firm, said there was a school of thought within OPEC Plus that the producers could begin easing the production cuts because theyll always have the flexibility to adjust or paus...",Business,rss.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/business/oil-prices-opec-tariffs.html,2025-03-08
"Hanford, a Contaminated Nuclear Site, It Set to Be Largest US Solar Farm","In the weeks since President Trump has taken office, he has pushed to unleash oil and gas production and has signed executive orders halting the countrys transition to renewable energy. But in Washington State, a government-led effort has just started to build what is expected to be the countrys largest solar generating station. The project is finally inching forward, after decades of cleaning up radioactive and chemical waste in fits and starts, at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, a sweep of desert that was pivotal to the nations weapons arsenal from 1943 until it was shut down in 1989. A developer, Hecate, was brought on last year to turn big stretches of the site into solar farms. Hecate will have access to 10,300 acres that the government has determined sufficiently safe to redevelop. The company has already started site evaluation on 8,000 acres, an area nearly 10 times the size of Central Park in New York and enough space for 3.45 million photovoltaic panels. (Hanfords site is about 400,000 acres.) If all goes according to plan, the Hecate project, which is expected to be completed in 2030, will be by far the largest site the government has cleaned up and converted from land that had been used for nuclear research, weapons and waste storage. It is expected to generate up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity  enough roughly to supply all the homes in Seattle, San Francisco, and Denver  and store 2,000 more in a large battery installation at a total cost of 4 billion. The photovoltaic panels and batteries will provide twice as much energy as a conventional nuclear power plant. The nations current biggest solar plant, the Copper Mountain Solar Facility in Nevada, can generate up to 802 megawatts of energy. The big unknown still hanging over the plan is whether the Trump administration will thwart efforts that the Biden administration put in place to develop more clean electricity generation.

Trump to Pause Auto Tariffs for Canada and Mexico for One Month,"President Trump said on Wednesday that he would pause tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico for one month, after a 25 percent tariff that he placed on Americas closest trading partners a day earlier roiled stock markets and prompted stiff resistance from industry. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, read a statement from Mr. Trump on Wednesday saying that White House had spoken with the three largest auto makers, and that a one-month exemption would be given to cars coming in through United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. At the request of the companies associated with U.S.M.C.A., the president is giving them an exemption for one month so they are not at an economic disadvantage, the statement said. The three automakers that Mr. Trump spoke with were General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis. Asked why Mr. Trump granted only a one-month reprieve, Ms. Leavitt said the president expected the automakers to move production back to the United States. The message, she said, was to get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the United States of America where they will pay no tariffs. The reprieve was a demonstration of the haphazard approach Mr. Trump has taken to trade policy, with the president announcing, pausing and then proceeding with a policy that is deeply influential for the North American economy within a matter of weeks. The decision came after Mr. Trump hosted a conference call Tuesday with Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors; John Elkann, the chairman of Stellantis; William C. Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor; and Jim Farley, Fords chief executive, according to a person briefed on the call. The executives told the president that putting tariffs on cars and parts from Canada and Mexico would effectively erase all of their companies profits by imposing billions of dollars of new costs on them, the person said. They asserted that cars built in those countries supported jobs in the United States at parts factories, dealers and other related businesses. Supply chains extend across U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada, making it hard to say whats American-made.

Trans Workers Describe a ‘Betrayal’ by an Agency Meant to Protect Them,"When Asher Lucass co-workers started taunting him for being transgender, saying he was born a girl and needed to be a girl, he figured this type of bullying would not be tolerated at a well-known restaurant. But after complaining to his manager, Mr. Lucas was fired along with three employees who spoke up on his behalf. This cannot be legal, Mr. Lucas remembers thinking when his boss told him in a voice mail message that he was fired. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agreed with Mr. Lucas. In October, the agency sued his employer, Culvers, in federal court in Michigan, saying the restaurant had engaged in unlawful employment practices by allowing co-workers to harass Mr. Lucas because he is transgender and retaliating against those who opposed the harassment. But in the last several weeks, the E.E.O.C., the nations primary regulator focused on workplace discrimination, made an about-face in Mr. Lucass case and in several others involving transgender and nonbinary workers. It moved to dismiss the case against Culvers, arguing it could run afoul of President Trumps executive order asserting that there are only two sexes, male and female.

Adidas Has Sold Its Last Yeezy Sneaker,"Adidas said Wednesday that it had sold its last pair of Yeezys, a wildly popular and profitable sneaker brand it developed with the rapper and designer Ye, as it tried to move past the publicity nightmare that followed after Yes antisemitic comments. The sportswear giant severed ties with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, in 2022 after he posted antisemitic remarks on social media and made other offensive comments publicly. Adidas had said that ending its nearly decade-long collaboration with the American entertainer cost it nearly 250 million euros that year. The rapper apologized to the Jewish community in 2022 only to later retract his apology in a barrage of social media posts in February in which he declared he was a Nazi. The sale of Adidass remaining Yeezy inventory generated about 50 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, boosting the companys overall revenue to 5.97 billion, up 24 percent from a year earlier, Adidas said Wednesday in an earnings report. But the sports brand was cautious in its outlook, cutting its revenue growth forecast for 2025 to 10 percent, from 12 percent last year. It was the first time, the company said, that the outlook did not include revenue from the Yeezy line. The breakup was hardest felt in North America, where the apparel was driven by the Grammy-winning rappers popularity. Sales in North America declined 2 percent solely due to significantly lower Yeezy sales, said Adidas, which is based in Herzogenaurach, Germany. Bjorn Gulden, who became chief executive in 2023, said the company would cut up to 500 jobs at its headquarters to shift decision-making to offices around the globe. We need to reduce complexity, he said, adding that it made little sense for employees in Germany to decide what was needed in markets abroad. After ending its ties with Ye, the apparel company struggled with slowing sales and revelations that it had ignored the rappers misconduct for years. The severed contract also left Adidas with mountains of sneakers and clothing, and potential losses of 1.2 billion in sales and about 500 million in profit last year. Under Mr. Gulden, Adidas decided in 2023 not to write off the remaining Yeezy stock but sell it and donate part of the profit to organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and Robert Krafts Foundation to Combat Antisemitism. On Wednesday, Mr. Gulden struck an optimistic tone, signaling the companys eagerness to put the Yeezy scandal behind it with new celebrity collaborations and a focus on other popular sneaker lines, like the Samba, a decades old brand that has had a resurgence in popularity. With all the challenges out there, lets not forget that there are so many fun things to look forward to in 2025, Mr. Gulden said.

China’s Economic Plan Is Light on Detail as Trade War Intensifies,"For months, China has promised to help its people spend more to turn the economy around, while taking few concrete measures. On Wednesday, the countrys top leaders pledged to vigorously boost spending but once again offered limited details and little money to back it up. The governments budget and annual work report, released on the most important day in Chinas political calendar, during the meeting in Beijing called the National Peoples Congress, set an optimistic target of 5 percent growth but gave scant indication of how the economy would get there without another surge in exports this year. Chinas reliance on trade for growth faces fresh challenges as the United States and many other countries have raised tariffs on Chinese goods. The headwinds remain very strong on growth: The property market hasnt stabilized, and consumer confidence remains low, said Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS. Now we have a fresh wave of tariffs, and who knows what else will come. Policy needs to do the heavy lifting. Here are some key takeaways from Chinas budget  and what it means for one of the worlds biggest economies. China is one of the few places in the world with deflation, an economic condition in which many prices are falling. That might sound appealing to Americans struggling with hefty bills for groceries and other expenses, but it can be a crippling problem: Many companies and households have seen their earnings shrink in recent years. Deflation also raises the cost of debt payments and encourages consumers to put off purchases on the expectation of lower prices in the future. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump’s Next Tariff Moves,"For months, the debate gripping board rooms, Wall Street and world capitals was whether to take President Trump at his word on tariffs. For a while, the markets rallied as if he were just bluffing. He wasnt. In an address before Congress last night, Trump said that tariffs would protect American jobs and enrich the nation. He also acknowledged that there will be a little disturbance. But were OK with that. What might a a little disturbance look like? DealBook has taken on the task of gaming out what could happen next. (A warning to free-trade advocates: this could be tough reading.) More tariffs are coming, trade experts say. Few countries, or companies, will be spared. For example, if the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China stick, then Europe will be next. Such a scenario is unavoidable, George Saravelos, the global head of FX Research at Deutsche Bank, said in a research note on Tuesday. European companies are already bracing for the next wave. Trump has appeared to be less amenable to carve-outs in this second term, David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, told DealBook. That could bode poorly, he added, for Britain, whose prime minister, Keir Starmer, met with Trump at the White House last week where a trade deal was discussed. I dont think Keir Starmer should just feel safe right now, Seif said. Expect more market turmoil. These tariffs would represent a major negative global growth shock, sufficient to push many economies into recession, Saravelos wrote, adding that its time to stop thinking of them as a negotiating tactic. (The recessionary risk for the United States may be remote, but concerns are growing about the tariffs potential stagflationary effects.) We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"US economy facing potential slowdown amid ‘heightened uncertainty’, says Fed chair","Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell said it was in no rush to cut interest rate as government overhauls key policies The US economy faces a potential slowdown in consumer spending amid heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook among businesses, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, said on Friday. The central bank chief said the Fed will be in no rush to cut interest rates while it waits for more clarity on how the policies of the new Trump administration affect the economy. The new administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy and regulation, Powell said in remarks prepared for delivery at a University of Chicago Booth School of Business economic forum in New York City. Uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. We are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity. Powell spoke at a volatile time, with stock markets and bond yields both declining in the wake of Donald Trumps whiplash announcements of steep import tariffs on major trading partners Mexico and Canada, followed by delays in implementing them. Trump has also doubled tariffs on imports from China. Though Powell said the economy continues to be in a good place, he added: It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment. Still, key indicators remain solid, Powell added, with ongoing, if uneven, progress on inflation and continued job gains. With the US government on Friday reporting job growth of 151,000 in February, Powell noted the economy has been adding a solid 191,000 jobs a month since September. Some measures of short-term inflation expectations have moved higher, Powell said, but most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2 inflation goal. Whether inflation slows faster than expected or the economy does start to weaken, our current policy stance is well positioned to respond, he said. The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the current 4.25-4.50 range at its 18 and 19 March policy meeting. Policymakers will also issue new economic projections that will give insight into how the first two months of the Trump administration have influenced the outlook for inflation, employment, growth and the path of interest rates. Investors have begun taking the possibility of an economic slowdown more seriously, and now expect the Fed to approve three quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year.

‘Bloody awful!’: Martin Lewis hits out at crypto scams costing victims dear,"Crypto cons top the list of investment frauds, with Elon Musk also among the figures used in fake ads Martin Lewis and Elon Musk dont appear to have much in common. One is a trusted British personal finance guru; the other is the worlds richest person and a close ally of Donald Trump. However, their wisdom and wealth respectively make them a powerful weapon for scammers. I have the dubious honour  of being used in more scam ads than anyone else in the UK, even though I never do any advertising, Lewis tells the Guardian. If you add in Elon Musk, between us we are the huge majority of scam ads, says the MoneySavingExpert.com founder, referring to data compiled by Action Fraud, the UKs centre for collating allegations of cybercrime. Lewiss status as a force for good means that when he offers advice, people take notice. As a result, fraudsters capitalise on his clout with the public to send what are shortcut psychological messages, he says. I am there to portray trusted financial source, Elon Musk has huge wealth. This week, a Guardian investigation into a 35m (27m) fraud shone a spotlight on the tactics that investment scammers use to cheat Britons out of millions of pounds every week. The fraud was exposed by a huge leak of scam call centre data to the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, which shared the files with international media partners. Out of about 2,000 victims persuaded to part with the largest sums, 652 were from the UK. So how can you, or your loved ones, avoid joining their ranks? When it comes to investment scams, fake cryptocurrency tops the list, but scammers dangle too-good-to-be-true opportunities to buy other things such as gold, wine, property, carbon credits and land banking, where land is divided into smaller plots to sell to investors. The latest data from the banking trade body UK Finance showed investment scammers cheated Britons out of 56m in the first six months of 2024. However, the true total will be much higher, as many victims do not report the crime, often because they feel embarrassed or ashamed that they were taken in. These scams are usually a type of authorised push payment (APP) fraud, which involves tricking someone into voluntarily sending money from their bank account. For the victims, it often starts by clicking on a (fake) social media advert or news alert. This typically is a tip for a supposedly great crypto investment, but is in fact a trick that leads only to fraudsters who are impersonating a real business. Eager investors hand over a small sum at first, say 250, and before they know it  thanks to things such as sophisticated software that displays a seemingly live trading screen  they are getting rich.

London councils buy £140m of property to move homeless people out of city,"Exclusive: More than a dozen authorities have bought more than 850 properties in English towns and cities since 2017 London councils and housing companies they own have spent more than 140m buying up homes to relocate homeless people out of the city. More than a dozen councils in the capital have collectively spent millions buying up more than 850 properties in towns and cities across England since 2017, Guardian analysis of property ownership data found. The homes are either owned directly by councils or by companies they partly or wholly own. They are used to house homeless individuals and families, either temporarily in emergency accommodation or permanently in privately rented homes. Most of the homes are in deprived areas in the south-east and east of England that are already under huge pressures due to homelessness among their own residents. But in the past year London councils have looked farther afield, buying up a small number of properties in the Midlands and laying out plans to buy more in north-east England. Housing charities said families lives were thrown into turmoil by being moved away from their communities. Labour MPs urged the government to reconsider its approach to the scarring out-of-area placements, which are at their highest levels since records began. Waltham Forest and Bromley councils, via companies they jointly own with the housing and social care company Mears Group, have collectively spent almost 80m buying more than 500 homes in areas including Harlow and Thurrock in Essex and Maidstone in Kent since 2017. Both councils use these properties to discharge their homelessness duties and permanently rehouse people out of London. Brent council has spent more than 18m buying 75 properties across Milton Keynes, Hemel Hempstead and Slough, while Barnet council has spent more than 10m buying nearly 70 properties in Peterborough and Luton. Brent and Barnet used companies they wholly owned to make these purchases since 2017. Housing Gateway, a company wholly owned by Enfield council, spent 13m in 2018 buying Greenway House, a converted office block on the outskirts of Harlow with 83 flats that are used as temporary accommodation. The Guardian previously revealed that councils had paid millions to relocation companies to help them permanently move homeless people to the Midlands and north of England. Recent property purchases suggest that some London councils are starting to move the practice in-house. In December, Enfield council laid out plans to buy 28 homes through Housing Gateway around Liverpool this year. It said these properties would initially be used as temporary accommodation with the aim of finding homeless households long-term housing in the area once relocated. Redbridge council, which has spent more than 10m buying 55 properties outside the capital since 2020, has bought homes 100 miles away in Coventry and Leicester in the past year. They are being used as temporary accommodation but the council said it planned t...",Business,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/08/london-councils-buy-140m-property-move-homeless-people-out-city,2025-03-08
Trump hosts crypto leaders after creating strategic reserve of bitcoin,"Chiefs from Coinbase, Ripple and Robinhood to strategize with president on how to make US crypto capital of world Cryptocurrency industry elite met with Donald Trump at the White House on Friday to discuss how the government will enact Trumps vision of making the country the crypto capital of the world. During the round-table summit, which had more than a dozen attendees, the president thanked each of his guests. High-IQ individuals around this table, high-IQ, Trump said. We feel like pioneers. Trump hosted players including crypto entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; Michael Saylor, co-founder and the executive chair of MicroStrategy; and Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the presidents own crypto business, World Liberty Financial.Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood Markets, also attended. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday creating a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency for the United States. During the summit, he said this reserve will be like a digital Fort Knox for digital gold to be stored. David Sacks, a tech investor whom Trump has named his crypto czar, thanked the president for his leadership in the digital asset industry and remarked: Your administration is moving at tech speed. This was an industry that was subjected to persecution, Sacks said. And no one understands that better than you do. After the initial introductions, the attenders began their off-camera summit. The event is expected to focus on Trumps plans to build the strategic reserve, which the president said will contain bitcoin and four other coins. Trump directed the secretaries of treasury and commerce to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin that have no incremental costs on taxpayers.

The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, Sacks earlier said in a post on social media platform X. This strategic reserve is going to be the biggest point of contention for many of us, said JP Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Exodus, a bitcoin wallet developer. Although he owns the four other coins that Trump has suggested including in the reserve, he does not think they have a place in a strategic reserve. Crypto has made big strides, but its still a relatively nascent industry, Richardson said. The other coins are smaller and function in a very different way, one he said may create more risk.

"Andrew Bailey was accused by Barclays chair of having ‘destroyed’ Jes Staley, court hears","Nigel Higgins asked if FCA would drop investigation into Staleys relationship with Epstein if CEO quit The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, was accused by the Barclays chair of having destroyed Jes Staley, a court heard on Friday, after the City watchdog led by Bailey at the time launched an investigation into the bankers ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Nigel Higgins, who made the accusations and is still the Barclays chair, also asked in 2019 whether the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would be willing to drop its investigation if Staley resigned. We discussed whether there was a way for Mr Staley to step down from his position in order to avoid the investigation, which may have had some attraction for Barclays and Mr Staley, Bailey said in a witness statement. However, he told Higgins it would be impossible to ignore a cache of emails from JP Morgan, which included a notorious exchange discussing Disney princess characters. I explained that there was no way that we could avoid asking Mr Staley about the Snow White email, Bailey, who was then running the FCA, said. Given that this was suggestive of a closer relationship, it was impossible that we could just ignore them. In those messages from 2010, Staley contacted Epstein, saying say hi to Snow White. Epstein replied what character would you like next?, to which Staley answered Beauty and the Beast. The court was shown notes taken by Higgins after a call with Bailey, in which the former is said to have declared you have destroyed him, in an apparent reference to Staley. I dont see any evidence of a lack of integrity, the note adds. I do remember a conversation along those lines, yes, Bailey told the court. The conversations with Higgins were detailed in witness evidence, as Bailey took the stand at the upper tribunal. Bailey, who wore a dark suit and purple tie, was sat metres from Staley as he was cross-examined by Robert Smith KC, who is trying to overturn an FCA decision in 2023 to ban Staley from senior roles in the UK financial sector. That decision, which also cost Staley 18m in pay and bonuses at Barclays, came after an FCA investigation found he had misled the regulator after a Barclays letter from October 2019 said Epstein and Staley did not have a close relationship. Staley resigned in 2021 over the investigations preliminary findings, which were formally released in 2023.

US owner of UK pharmacy chain Boots to be taken private in $10bn deal,"Sale of Walgreens Boots Alliance to Sycamore Partners will mean further uncertainty for pharmacy chain staff The US owner of Boots is to be taken private in a 10bn (7.8bn) deal that will mean further uncertainty for thousands of workers at the UK-based pharmacy chain. Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates more than 1,800 Boots stores in the UK, has been sold to the US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The chain has been struggling as customers turn to online shopping for cheaper products. Walgreens market value has collapsed by 90 since 2015 and is valued at 9.3bn. It has debt and lease obligations of 30bn. Sycamore Partners has struck an 11.45-a-share deal for Walgreens Boots Alliance, giving it an equity value of about 10bn. Sycamore is expected to retain the US retail business and sell or spin off the rest, including the UK chemist chain Boots, which traces its roots to John Boots first Nottingham store in 1849. Boots has more than 50,000 employees, including at its headquarters in Nottingham, who face further uncertainty after more than three years of speculation over its future ownership. In a letter to staff, seen by the Guardian, Ornella Barra, the head of Walgreens international business including Boots, said the deal was a significant development for the division, adding: Its important to note that nothing is changing today. In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale with a suggested price tag of up to 10bn but later dropped the plans as potential buyers, including Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries, the US private equity investor Apollo Global Management and Asdas owners TDR Capital, struggled to raise funds. A plan to float the business at a valuation of about 7bn was dropped last year. Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said Sycamore was likely to seek a swift sale of Boots to a private equity buyer in the first instance as it will care more about making money now rather than later. Mould said considerable headwinds for UK retailers, including rising costs and low consumer confidence as household bills continued to rise amid global political and economic difficulties, may make Boots a tough sell. Fears are also growing for hundreds of WH Smith stores as its listed owner tries to sell its estate of more than 500 shops on the high street to focus on its more successful travel arm. However, in recent years, Boots has improved its pricing, closed hundreds of ageing stores and improved its beauty ranges to benefit from a shift among young people towards spending on cosmetics and beauty products rather than fashion. It could also benefit from the Labour governments shift towards primary healthcare in which pharmacies are expected to play a bigger role. Patrick OBrien at the retail analysts GlobalData said a successful sale of Boots would depend on whether Sycamore was prepared to accept a lower figure than the ludicrous valuation previously sought by Walgreens. He said: Boots has improved dramatically since then but the v...",Business,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/07/us-owner-of-uk-pharmacy-chain-boots-to-be-taken-private-in-10bn-deal,2025-03-08
UK Treasury ‘weighs up funding cuts at GB Energy’ in blow to Ed Miliband,"Government considering such a move over state-owned firm set up by Labour in Junes spending review, say reports The UK government is reportedly weighing up the possibility of cutting planned funding for GB Energy, the state-owned company set up by Labour to drive renewable energy and cut household bills, in Junes spending review. Cuts to the 8.3bn of taxpayer money promised over the five-year parliament would be another blow for Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, after he was overruled by the government when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backed the expansion of Heathrows third runway. GB Energy, a vital cog in Keir Starmers plans to supercharge Britains clean energy revolution, was only given an initial 100m in Octobers budget to cover its first two years. Ministers are carrying out a zero-based review of all government spending, which has been given additional impetus after Starmers pledge to boost investment in defence. One option under consideration by the Treasury is to cut 3.3bn earmarked for GB Energy to fund low-interest loans via local authorities, for projects such as solar panels and shared-ownership wind projects, according to the Financial Times. A Treasury spokesperson said: We are fully committed to the 8.3bn for GB Energy, which is at the heart of our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower and to ensure our homes are cheaper and cleaner to run. Sources played down the likelihood of the government significantly defunding an initiative that formed an important plank of Labours energy strategy. One source suggested that the government might maintain the promised level of funding but rebadge the budgets of other green initiatives to become part of GB Energy, effectively allowing departmental cuts in other areas. The speculation will, however, reignite rumours of a power battle within Labour ranks, pitched between No 10, the Treasury and Milibands net zero department. Last year, before Labours election victory, Starmer cut its green investment plan from 28bn a year to under 15bn, in a blow to Miliband. Sources close to the government said the Treasury was now running the rule over everything before the spring statement this month, which is expected to show that Reevess headroom against her fiscal rules has been wiped out. Another source warned of a rerun of the febrile months before the autumn budget, when swirling speculation hit business confidence and investment. GB Energy has the potential to be a real confidence booster to business. Scaling it back would damage investor sentiment and, frankly, be electoral madness. Its hugely popular on the doorstep, especially in Scotland, they said. Last month, GB Energy admitted that it could take 20 years to meet its pledge to employ 1,000 people, as the chair, Jürgen Maier, refused to put a date on when it would bring down energy bills.

Britons snacking less as they drift back to office after pandemic,"People snacked at home on more than 15 fewer occasions in 2024 than in 2020 and are choosing healthier options Hold the biscuits, popcorn and chocolate and hand out the rice cakes, apples and halloumi, the UK is cutting back on snacks and shifting to healthier options amid tighter budgets and bulging waistlines. Britons had a snack at home on more than 15 fewer occasions in 2024 than in 2020  as a boom in self-treating during the pandemic lockdowns subsided, according to the retail market analysts Kantar. Even when snacking on the go is included, we are munching about 2 less than during the pandemic and even a bit less than before Covid reshaped our lives. Nathan Ward from Kantar said: Working from home has made a massive difference. During the pandemic we did snack more as we were in the home and availability does drive consumption. As people have drifted back to work snacking has declined. Ananda Roy, at the market research firm Circana, said: We are seeing the world return to normal. He says treats are far from off the menu but the future of snacking is going to be different with more fruit, nuts, yoghurts, protein bars and cheese, and fewer chocolatey treats and biscuits. Last year, we snacked on 350m fewer occasions at home compared with the previous year, according to Kantar. Consumers bought about 1.5 fewer sweets and chocolate bars over the year, according to Circana data, and about 6 fewer packs of crisps than in 2021. In contrast, snacking on fruit was up 4 last year, according to Kantar, while we bought 1.2 more nuts and 16 more protein bars, drinks and powders, according to the Grocers top products research with the analyst NIQ. Protein snacks are experiencing a particular boost from healthy eating trends, with special drinks, nuts and even boiled eggs now more popular, as well as foods with more fibre, such as low-sugar smoothies. Waitrose said it had seen a demand for more functional snacks, such as crispy seaweed, as customers sought out healthier foods. Households are also seeking out less processed treats  such as carrot sticks, apple slices, olives and salads  amid concerns about the health implications of ultra-processed foods. Increasingly, consumers are using fresh fruit and vegetables as part of their snack repertoire, Roy said. The rise in the cost of cocoa, sugar and other indulgent commodities is partly behind the shift, with the amount of chocolate bought down by 11 since 2021, according to Circana. Crisp sales have also been hit by price rises prompted by poor potato harvests. The UKs biggest brand, Walkers, for instance, sold 2.6m fewer kilograms of crisps last year as average prices increased 4.1 according to the Grocer. Jonny Forsyth, a senior director of food and drink research at Mintel, said: The elevated cost of living has dampened sales of snacks. Rules that forced supermarkets to display high fat and sugar foods in less prominent positions from October 2022 have also had an impact.

Royal Mail to increase price of first-class stamp to £1.70,"Cost of second-class service to rise to 87p in sixth increase in little more than three years Royal Mail is to increase the cost of first- and second-class stamps for what will be the sixth time in little more than three years. From 7 April, the price of a first-class stamp will increase by 5p, or 3, to 1.70. The cost of the second-class service is going up by 2p, or 2.4, to 87p. In a statement Royal Mail blamed the need for price increases on rising costs. We always consider price changes very carefully but the cost of delivering mail continues to increase, said Nick Landon, its chief commercial officer. A complex and extensive network of trucks, planes and 85,000 posties is needed to ensure we can deliver across the country for just 87p. A decade ago Royal Mail was delivering 20bn letters a year but that has shrunk to 6.7bn and could drop to 4bn within four years. Over the same timeframe the number of addresses it serves has risen by 4m, meaning the cost of each delivery continues to rise, it said. Royal Mail was fined more than 10m in December by the postal regulator Ofcom for missing its delivery targets, as more than a quarter of first-class mail arrived late. The postal service has been pushing to reduce deliveries, and Ofcom has given provisional approval to allow Royal Mail to deliver second-class letters on alternate weekdays and to stop Saturday deliveries. First-class letters would still be delivered six days a week under the plans. A final decision is expected in the summer. Ofcom has recognised that reform is urgently needed to protect the one-price-goes-anywhere universal service which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters to about 32m UK addresses six days a week, Landon said. Reform will allow continued investment in the modernisation and transformation of the business to provide a more financially sustainable service. The price rises come before big changes at the carrier.

‘Don’t punish the vulnerable’: Labour MPs uneasy over planned welfare cuts,"Ministers say unsustainable rise in spending must be tackled but many backbenchers fear changes will not work Dozens of backbench Labour MPs are unhappy with plans to cut billions from the rising welfare bill, with ministers holding meetings to convince them that the changes to disability benefits are necessary. Labour MPs told the Guardian there were deep concerns within the parliamentary party that the changes would take money from the poorest, which was not what they had entered government to do. No 10 is preparing to make the case for welfare cuts before Rachel Reevess spring statement, with Keir Starmers spokesperson saying on Friday that there had been an unsustainable rise in welfare spending. Our broken social security system is holding our people back, our economy back, he said. Weve got 3 million people out of work for health reasons, one in eight young people are not currently in work, education or training, and that is a shocking situation to be in. He added: Left as it is, the system weve inherited would continue to leave more and more people trapped in a life of unemployment and inactivity, and thats not just bad for the economy, its bad for those people too, and its why this government is going to set up plans to overhaul the health and disability benefits system in the coming weeks. No 10 said the prime minister was in agreement with Reeves, who told Sky the welfare system was letting down taxpayers because it cost too much. We dont need an Office for Budget Responsibility forecast to tell us that weve got to reform our welfare system, the chancellor said. The government is trying to separate the arguments about changes to the welfare system from Reevess need to find savings and balance the books, with proposals expected before the spring statement. Given the governments large majority, there is little chance of it failing to push through its planned changes to the disability benefit system, but some Labour MPs said they would nevertheless struggle to vote for any measures that take money away from the poorest in society. Labour MPs said they had met ministers in small groups about the proposals for welfare changes and some have also written to the Department for Work and Pensions expressing concerns. One senior Labour MP said there had not been enough effort to work on the reasons for higher disability benefit payments, from poor mental health provision and long waiting lists to declining health and life expectancy in many parts of the country. We are a rich country but we have lots of poorer people. Do not target stuff at the poorest and most vulnerable. There are others ways of doing it, the MP said. There are lots of backbenchers concerned about this  its unhelpful in terms of how this has been trailed in the media and I feel that its too politically slanted as well. You cant outflank the right.

WW2 bomb defused on rail tracks near Paris after day of transport chaos,"Unexploded device found near Gare du Nord, Frances busiest train terminal, halting Eurostar and other services A second world war bomb found on rail tracks north of Paris was successfully defused on Friday after a day of transport chaos in which the Gare du Nord, used by Eurostar trains from London as well as other high-speed and local services, was shut, roads were closed and dozens of residents were evacuated in the suburb of St-Denis. The unexploded bomb weighing 500kg was found in the middle of a set of tracks during maintenance work in the early hours of Friday morning in the Parisian suburb, about 1.5 miles (2.5km) from the major station. After a day of police bomb disposal work, cancelled trains, closed roads, the evacuation of dozens of people whose homes had windows facing the site, and a lockdown of six local schools, the device, which contained 200kg of explosives, was successively deactivated at about 5pm local time (1600 GMT). Bombs from the first and second world wars are regularly discovered in France. The device was found 2 metres below the ground in a location known for potential second world war debris. The rail maintenance work had been carried out with special precautions. When the device was found, work stopped and experts were called in, with the perimeter extended to 1km on Friday morning. Local authorities in St-Denis said people were evacuated from some buildings whose windows faced towards the site where the bomb was being deactivated. Six schools and a care home in the area were also locked down for an hour, although local authorities said there was no risk to them. Part of the Paris ring road and the A1 motorway was closed to traffic owing to the disposal operations, the police prefecture said. Matthieu Chabanel, the head of the rail infrastructure management unit SNCF Réseau, said that finding a bomb of such size was really quite exceptional. We know that during world war two, the rail network was heavily bombed, especially here north of Paris where there were also many factories, he told reporters. So we are particularly vigilant when we carry out work in this area and we detect an abnormal situation, which is what happened last night. He added that police teams had been notified immediately. It was not clear at first when and by whom the bomb was dropped and if it dated to before or after the 1940 occupation of Paris by Nazi Germany. All rail traffic to the Gare du Nord, Frances busiest railway terminal, was stopped as Paris police worked to disable the device. The Gare du Nord is a major European transit hub, serving international destinations such as Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as the main Paris airport and many regional destinations. The station, in the north of the French capital, serves an estimated 700,000 people each day, according to the SNCF national rail company. The French transport minister, Philippe Tabarot, said defusing operations were finally over, they went well.

Allowing foreign firms to sue governments for lost profits is legal terrorism – it must end | Joseph Stiglitz,"Investorstate dispute settlements dont just mean growing debt burdens for countries: they are also a barrier to action on the climate crisis Donald Trump has thrown a hand grenade into the global economic architecture, destroying some things that are working well. But amid the devastation, some things seem to be surviving that really should be taken down. Among the most notable of these is an arcane set of international agreements by which private investors can sue governments, known as ISDS: investor-state dispute settlement. These disputes are litigated not in public courts with impartial judges but in private arbitration  behind closed doors, and rife with conflicts of interest. Early on, when they were snuck into many trade agreements, no one paid much attention. For instance, these provisions in Nafta, the so-called free trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada, never got a discussion within the cabinet while I served in the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton when Nafta got adopted. What is it? Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) was created to help companies protect investments abroad. It allows companies to sue countries for lost profits caused by government action including corruption, seizure of assets or the introduction of health and environmental policies. The system was created in the 1960s by the World Bank. It was intended to give companies confidence to invest in poorer countries with weak political systems where they might not get a fair hearing in domestic courts. How does it work? The foreign company must put forward a case showing that the state has damaged its profits. Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals include ISDS clauses. Cases are heard by a private arbitration tribunal, and typically decided by a panel of three arbitrators  one chosen by the company, one chosen by the state and the third selected jointly. How much are the cases worth? Awards regularly amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, and some are in the billions. In 2024 the average amount awarded was 385m (304m). The average sum awarded is increasing and these payouts can make up a sizeable chunk of poorer countries annual budgets. Who is involved? The fossil fuel and mining industries are the most litigious in the ISDS system, accounting for more than 30 of known cases. Most claims are brought by companies based in rich countries against the governments of developing countries. Companies registered in developed countries file 81 of ISDS lawsuits, according to UN data, while developing countries have faced 62 of cases. How common is it? ISDS began as an obscure legal mechanism, averaging about one case a year for its first decade. Now, dozens are brought every year, with Guardian analysis finding more than 900 since 2013. The provisions were sold as protecting property rights from expropriation  but that was nonsense: few expropriations occur today, and the World Bank and governments around the world pr...",Business,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/07/private-investors-ability-to-sue-governments-is-a-form-of-legal-terrorism-ending-this-system-is-imperative-aoe,2025-03-08
Military spending is touted as a remedy for Britain’s ailing economy. Here’s why it won’t work | Khem Rogaly,"Since the 1980s Britains military spending has grown in real terms, yet more than half of military jobs have been lost. The sector is hi-tech and low labour Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have announced their latest rescue remedy for Britains economy. Old promises  good jobs, thriving small businesses and regional equality  will now be delivered by an increased military budget, used to buy equipment from the private sector. More military spending is not a tonic, however, but a poison that will worsen our economic ills and make Britain less safe in the long run. Assurances of prosperity for small businesses and ex-industrial towns rest on a misleading depiction of military spending. Last financial year, 56 of Ministry of Defence spending with UK businesses went to London and the south of England. In the same year, nearly 40 of the 37.6bn military equipment budget went to just 10 multinational companies. Slashing red tape and granting small businesses more access to the military budget will not build a family-run missile factory on every street corner of ex-industrial Britain. BAE Systems, leading weapons dealer to government and happy recipient of 15 of the equipment budget, has just declared record orders and rising profits. Military contractors are large multinationals that reward their asset manager shareholders from government contracts: since 2015, BAE has paid out 9.8bn to shareholders while receiving more than a fifth of its global revenue each year from the British government. While in a few specific areas, communities are reliant on jobs at military contractors, this is the result of public spending decisions, not the benevolence or dynamism of private companies. Although the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard now relies on contracts to build nuclear submarines, in the early 1960s its most profitable work was making engines for British Rail. Policy choices have left communities dependent on military contracts because of divestment from public services and civilian industry. Regardless, military spending is not a viable strategy for growth or the creation of good jobs nationally: Ministry of Defence spending on business directly supports 130,000 full-time jobs in the UK; if including supply chains, this rises to 209,000 or 0.83 of the workforce. Even with the military budget set to grow further over the next parliament, the industry it supports is too small to transform the nations economy. More important, the connection between military spending and job creation has weakened over time. Despite falling as a share of GDP, Britains military budget has grown in real terms since the early 1980s  the height of the cold war  yet at the same time more than half of jobs in the military industry have been lost. The military sector is increasingly a hi-tech employer that relies less on manufacturing and more on IT and engineering jobs in the south of England.

She has proposed a plan that would offer 800bn (660bn) for immediate rearming, with a European sky shield to protect Ukraine. The hooligan Russian asset in the White House has changed everything so profoundly that it is hard to keep track. The US, whose coat-tails we clung to, whose culture we revelled in, whose cleverness dazzled and stupidity confounded, is now the enemy. The shock feels viscerally personal because American culture is deep in our veins at all ages, from Sesame Street to Marvel, from Philip Roth to Philip Glass, the Oscars to Silicon Valley, like it or not. In Iraq and Afghanistan, we obediently followed their blunders, and 642 British soldiers died, as Keir Starmer adroitly reminded JD Vance in parliament. Our glamorous friend has turned fiend. How do we cauterise that off us? Or reconfigure the map of the world in terms of friends and foes? Former UK ambassadors to Washington ruminated over this seismic shift, which has shaken every norm from their Foreign Office days. This is not a blip in the relationship, something fundamental is going on, one old knight warned a Lords select committee, while another cautioned that the US giving up on Europe in favour of Russia was likely a current reality. Sir David Manning pinpointed Britains specific anguish at this moment, the downside of the so-called special relationship: as Europe galvanises to rearm, unlike our continental neighbours, we depend on the US for our defence. With every new shock wave, Britain feels this trauma in its marrow. Yet there is hesitancy in government about addressing the nation with a call to arms, as French president Emmanuel Macron has done, warning: the innocence of these 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall is over. Look at the remarkable response of Germanys chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, lifetime financial conservative and fiscal dogmatist, as he grasps the severity of the times: he will reverse all his previous fiscal policies and his nations usual dread over borrowing, breaking their basic law with a huge 500bn loosening of debt rules to rearm. This amounts to one of the most historic paradigm shifts in German postwar history, according to Deutsche Bank. German borrowing costs shot up, but so have predictions of German growth from a sluggish 0.8 to 2, with investors sending industrial stocks soaring. But note this: in his fiscal sea change, rearming will not be accompanied by any cuts to German social spending. How about Britain? Our government ...",Business,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/07/britain-rearm-taxes-rachel-reeves-treasury-prime-minister-john-maynard-keynes,2025-03-08
"Taiwan hails ‘historic’ TSMC deal with US, but will it lose the ‘silicon shield’ protecting it from China?","The producer of the worlds most advanced chip technology is investing on US soil but some fear that could reduce the leverage Taiwan holds to ensure its future security TSMCs chief executive, CC Wei, smiled broadly as he stood next to Donald Trump in the White House on Monday, announcing what he said was the biggest foreign direct investment on US soil in history. His company  the producer of most of the worlds most advanced semiconductors  would boost its existing 65bn US presence by a whopping 100bn. For TSMC the deal meant they would avoid massive tariffs Trump had flagged for the global chip industry. For the US it mean tens of thousands of construction jobs, and the eventual development of crucial technology on US soil, far away from the threat of China taking control of it if it one day annexed Taiwan. The deal is not set in stone. Under Taiwanese law TSMC is required to have government approval for any foreign investment over 1.5bn  a fraction of this deals size. President Lai Ching-te said the government would review the deal with national interests in mind. The economic affairs ministry told the Guardian on Wednesday it hadnt received an application yet. But the deal has rung alarm bells. Members of the opposition KMT have said it could weaken Taiwans security. The more TSMC produces in the US, the lower Taiwans geopolitical importance will be, and the less incentive the US will have to help Taiwan in the future, said the KMT legislator Ko Ju-Chun. Taiwans chip industry  of which TSMC is the largest and most advanced member  contributes up to 15 of Taiwans GDP. It is also seen by many as Taiwans silicon shield, a significant piece of leverage to incentivise the world to help keep it  and the globally crucial chip supply  out of Chinese hands. As Donald Trump has signalled a diminished personal interest in defending Taiwan, such leverage has grown more important. Lais office has said it will ensure that TSMC will keep its most advanced manufacturing processes in Taiwan, but that statement that appeared at odds with what was said by Wei and Trump at the White House. Wei reportedly said the deal meant TSMC would be producing the most advanced chip on US soil, while Trump declared the most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America. When asked by the Guardian to define the most advanced tech that the government was pledging to keep onshore, given that TSMCs most advanced product  its two-nanometer chips  are already scheduled for US production, the economic affairs ministry appeared to suggest it was human talent. It described Taiwans lauded Stem training-to-employment pipeline that underpins the local chip industrys success. This is highly dependent on Taiwans high-quality semiconductor talents, an advantage that is difficult for other countries to replicate, the ministry said. Kwei-bo Huang, professor of diplomacy at Taiwans National ChengChi university, said the Lai administration needs to heed to peoples rising wor...",Business,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/07/taiwan-tsmc-deal-us-microchip-technology-investment,2025-03-08
Crypto giant Tether CEO on cooperating with Trump administration: ‘We’ve never been shady’,"Paolo Ardoino  head of the worlds most traded cryptocurrency, which is backed by Trump aide Howard Lutnick  claims Tether is benefiting the US Paolo Ardoino, CEO of the cryptocurrency company Tether, was flying over Switzerland last week as he contemplated the changing regulatory landscape. Tether used to be at war with the establishment. Now it is the establishment. The crypto giant  tether is the most traded cryptocurrency in the world  has had a strange trip. Four years ago, banks were dropping Tether as a client, and regulators in New York had the company against the wall over questions about commingled client and corporate funds. Treasury officials were complaining that dollar-backed cryptocurrencies enjoyed the international privileges of the dollar without the responsibilities of preventing its misuse. Federal investigators were looking into Tether for possible violations of anti-money-laundering and sanctions rules. The cryptocurrency industry anecdotally  and conspiratorially  describes the Biden administrations posture toward crypto as a systematic effort to debank crypto in the form of tactics such as Operation Choke Point 2.0. Ardoino says Tethers leadership needed to become globetrotters in search of someone to take their business. And its a lot of business. Tether currently is the 17th largest holder of US government debt, with nearly as much in treasury bonds in its digital vaults as Saudi Arabia. Tethers value remains stable because it is pegged one-to-one to the dollar, meaning the value of each individual tether coin is 1. The company backs the total value of the cryptocurrency with dollar assets like treasury bonds in an American bank  in this case, 140bn deposited with Cantor Fitzgerald. Tether comes just behind bitcoin and ethereum as the most valuable cryptocurrency, and by most measures it is the most widely traded. Investors in countries with unstable currencies, like Turkey or Argentina with their 40-plus inflation rates, use it to hold on to the value of their savings against the dollar. Crypto traders use tether to park their digital assets in a safe place. The degree of cooperation between Tether and law enforcement reflects an evolving shift in the governments posture toward the company, even as federal agencies had been cracking down on cryptocurrency more broadly under Joe Biden. Weve never been shady, Ardoino said. The company has been great. It has been attacked. Debanked. You know, when youre trying to be a disruptor  in a good sense  you are going to always be attacked by the establishment. Previous administrations hostility to crypto  and perhaps to tether in particular  was the product of strategic mistakes the company had made, Ardoino said. We were very naive. We thought: Oh, we are going to keep our head down. We were not communicating. We were not telling whats going on, and that was used against us, he said. And thats fair, right? So, if someone is not communicating, or you feel is not transparent enough,...",Business,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/07/tether-crypto-trump-interview,2025-03-08

"‘You get sucked in’: crypto scam victims on how they lost up to £162,000","Retired NHS doctor and others conned into investing  only to sink larger sums in trying to get cash back A sprat to catch a mackerel is how one victim describes being reeled in by the skameri working from call centres hundreds of miles away in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. It is the local term for scammers and a huge data leak reveals the inner workings of a fraud network that has tricked Britons out of 9m. Like in any call centre, the script is always the same. For the victim it starts by clicking on a (fake) social media ad or news alert. The promotion tips a great crypto investment but its a trick, leading only to fraudsters impersonating a real business. Eager investors hand over a relatively small sum at first, say 250, and before they know it  thanks to clever software displaying a seemingly live trading screen  they are getting rich. But the profit is fiction, serving as bait: victims lose the big money trying to cash out. The windfall is just one step away, blocked by the need for one more payment  a brokers fee, or a tax bill. It only ends when the victim is broke. The 1m audio files from the Georgia leak include the stories of thousands of victims. To uncover some of them we grouped calls by phone number, reviewing calls of 60 seconds or longer, and listened to how the scam unfolded. In some cases we spoke to those targeted about the impact it had on their lives. 135 calls, 45 hours Losses: 100,000 Lucy was looking for an investment after retiring early for health reasons and was interested in the exciting world of crypto. Unfortunately, this led the former retail worker to the scammers door. The brand they were promoting (AdmiralsFX) was a clone and over more than six months she lost nearly 100,000. To make transferring money easier they told her to open an account with Chase UK (the British retail arm of US bank JP Morgan) as her current bank, Lloyds, was old-fashioned and didnt get crypto. Initially it seemed to pay off as the investments she could see on her screen were rocketing in value. It was only when she tried to cash out that the stalling began. One ruse was that her cash would be released if the account balance was topped up to over six figures. So she took out loans totalling 25,000 (with the direct lender Bamboo and the online bank Zopa). Of course the payday never arrived and, unable to afford the repayments on the high interest loans she and her husband cashed in their pensions to repay them. They are now living on a single state pension. Talking about it now it just sounds so stupid, but there you go. It was a very dark time for me and I have tried to overcome how it made me feel, she says. Now I think, Why on Earth did I go through with this if I didnt understand it? But while I was on the phone I felt that I did. They were very, very clever. Having convinced her to install a screen-sharing app when she was moving money they were in the background telling her what to do. It is like being indoctrinated.

"Bank and building society users hit by 33 days of outages in two years, say MPs","Treasury committee finds disruption a result of 158 IT incidents affecting millions of customers Customers at Britains major banks and building societies suffered the equivalent of more than one months worth of IT failures in the last two years, MPs have said. Enquiries by the House of Commons Treasury committee have found that nine of the top banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated a total of at least 803 hours, the equivalent of more than 33 days, of unplanned tech and systems outages between January 2023 and February 2025. That disruption was caused by 158 banking IT failure incidents over the two-year period, which affected millions of customers ability to access and use services. This did not include the most recent major outage, last week, when customers of TSB, Nationwide, First Direct and Lloyds Banking Group  including its Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands  struggled to log into online bank accounts or suffering from payment delays. Losing access to banking services on payday can be a terrifying experience for families and individuals living paycheck to paycheck, explained Dame Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Treasury select committee. Even when rectified relatively quickly, it can cause real panic, which is why we wanted to get a proper understanding of why unplanned banking outages happen and how banks and building societies respond. The fact there has been enough outages to fill a whole month within the last two years shows customers frustrations are completely valid. The reality is that this data shows even the most successful banks and building societies hit technical glitches. Whats critical is they react swiftly and ensure customers are kept informed throughout. Barclays reported the most incidents, 33, which lasted 93 hours in total. It said it had paid out up to 4.99m compensation. That, though, did not include Barclays outage at the end of January and the start of February this year, during which 56 of online payments failed due to severe degradation of its mainframe processing performance. It expects to pay a total of between 5m and 7.5m in compensation to customers for inconvenience or distress. Among other banks, NatWest racked up the most time lost to outages, 194 hours, through just 13 incidents, for which it paid out 348,000. HSBC paid out 232,697 to its customers after 32 incidents led to 176 hours of disruption.",Business,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/mar/06/bank-and-building-society-users-hit-by-33-days-of-outages-in-two-years-say-mps,2025-03-08
Revealed: the scammers who conned savers out of $35m using fake celebrity ads,"Georgia-based group used deepfake videos and false news featuring Martin Lewis, Zoe Ball and Ben Fogle to promote fraudulent crypto schemes An organised network operating from the former Soviet state of Georgia has scammed thousands of savers from the UK, Europe and Canada out of 35m (27m) after they fell for fake celebrity adverts on Facebook and Google that the government promised to outlaw three years ago. Deepfake videos and fictional news reports featuring the money expert Martin Lewis, the radio DJ Zoe Ball and the adventurer Ben Fogle were used to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency and other investment schemes. The scammers are understood to have still been contacting victims in recent weeks. UK citizens were the hardest hit, accounting for a third  about 9m  of the money taken. The fraud was exposed by a huge leak of scam call centre data to the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, which then shared the files with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the Guardian and other international reporting partners. The UK government has introduced a new set of laws aimed at protecting children and adults online. However, while the online safety act has been passed into law and scam posts could soon prompt fines, the sections relating to fraudulent advertising by organisations are not expected to become active until next year. Cases of authorised push payment (APP) fraud  when a victim is tricked into sending money directly from their account  rose by 12 to more than 230,000 in 2023, according to the most recent figures from the trade body UK Finance, although the total money lost dipped. The leak, which contains over 1m recordings  including long exchanges with victims scammed out of significant amounts of money  allows rare insight into exactly how scammers created havoc in the lives of their victims. And it raises fresh questions about how successful governments, banks and technology companies have been in combating these frauds. Operating from three office blocks in Tbilisi and referring to themselves as the skameri, Georgian for scammers, a group of about 85 well-paid call centre agents has persuaded pensioners, employees and small business owners to transfers millions out of their savings accounts. Since May 2022, the data suggests this industrial scale boiler room fraud duped around 6,000 people across the globe out of 35m (27m). A separate dataset contained in the leak indicates that close to half  45  of attempted calls placed by the scammers were made to UK numbers. Of about 2,000 victims who were persuaded to part with the largest sums, 652 were based in the UK. The fake adverts, which often reference the billionaire Elon Musk, appear to have been placed by affiliate marketers, who communicated anonymously with the scammers and earned fees by gathering the contact details of potential victims.

"Deepfakes, cash and crypto: how call centre scammers duped 6,000 people","Nursing home resident and pensioners among thousands of victims of massive fraud network operating from Georgia Ben Fogle was not a happy man. Not sure I need to highlight this, the broadcaster posted on Instagram during the spring of 2024, but the deepfake of me from ITVs This Morning  circulating on Facebook and advertising crypto is a scam. Fogles warning showed a fictional news article, linking to a digitally doctored video, but not everybody noticed. One of those taken in was Mark, a franchise manager in his 30s from East Anglia, who in one click lurched towards losing his life savings. I watched the video of Ben Fogle, like trading, Mark said, recalling how the clip had promoted a cryptocurrency website called AdmiralsFX. So I just bang some details in and then I was contacted by a call centre. It was a 250 buy-in  I was like, Oh, well, its worth a go for that. Within a month, he had handed over 27,000  the equivalent of a years salary  and sounded less relaxed. On a call with the person he believed was his investment adviser, he pleaded: Ive lost all my money, mate  What have you done with it? Mark was far from alone and the sheer scale of this heist can now be revealed for the first time, thanks to a massive leak of data shared with the Guardian and international media partners by Swedish television channel SVT and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). Analysis of the files suggests at least 6,179 people were duped by an industrial-scale boiler room fraud operating inside three plush-looking offices in Tbilisi, the capital city of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Calling themselves the skameri  Georgian for scammers  a group of 85 call handlers and support staff made it their daily mission from May 2022 to relieve ordinary people of 35m (27m) of their savings. They routed the cash through what appears to be a sophisticated money-laundering network and yet, somehow, almost nobody seems to have noticed this sizeable venture, which appears to be still operating. With hindsight, the warnings were everywhere. AdmiralsFX, the investment platform Mark had started using, had already prompted a notification by the UKs Financial Conduct Authority stating it had been created by fraudsters to scam people. A related brand, also being promoted from Georgia and called Golden Currencies, had been given the same official treatment. Other celebrities whose images were used  including the money expert Martin Lewis and the radio DJ Zoe Ball  had issued their own warnings. For many that proved futile. Victims of the Georgian scam still frequently cited the deepfakes as the reason they pressed ahead. WARNING. THIS IS A SCAM BY CRIMINALS TRYING TO STEAL MONEY.

Sen. Blumenthal asks Visa for records of its payments deal with Elon Musk’s X,"In this article Sen. Richard Blumenthal this week pressed Visa for detailed plans and documents related to its deal to provide payments services to Elon Musks social media site, X, as it prepares to launch a digital wallet. Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and the ranking member of the Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, pointed to Musks role in hobbling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  the consumer watchdog that would be a key regulator of the X Money service  as among the reasons for the information request, according to a March 6 letter obtained by CNBC. Given the unique position of X Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Elon Musk as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency and his recent role in gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Visa stands to take advantage of the deep conflicts of interest and unscrupulous conduct of its new business partner, Blumenthal wrote. The Senate request is one of the first signs of scrutiny on Visa, which runs the worlds largest credit card network, after a late January announcement that it had agreed to power peer-to-peer payments on X. Days after the deal was disclosed, operatives from Musks Department of Government Efficiency gained access to CFPB data systems, leading to accusations that Musk wanted to kneecap a future regulator and that he could steal trade secrets of competitors to his nascent X Money service. The letter, addressed to Visa CEO Ryan McInerney, also cast doubts about whether a social media network known for bots, scams and hate speech would be able to prevent scams and fraud from proliferating on the site. Musk purchased the site in 2022, when it was known as Twitter. These concerns raise questions about Xs ability to protect consumers from fraud and scams as it ventures into the financial sector, Blumenthal wrote. As the largest payment processor in the world, Visa has a legal responsibility to ensure its network is free of financial crime such as scams and fraud, money-laundering, terrorist financing, and more, he said. Blumenthal asked for a detailed description of Visas plans to enable payments on X, including the business model of the service and Visas role in compliance with regulatory requirements around money laundering and illicit remittances. He also pressed Visa for all records related to the deal and communications between X, Visa, DOGE and CFPB personnel.

FAA briefly halts flights to several Florida airports after SpaceX rocket testing failure,"The Federal Aviation Administration briefly halted flights to several Florida airports on Thursday night after a SpaceX Starship testing failure. The incident marks the second time this year that SpaceX experienced a mishap during a flight test of Starship resulting in debris raining down and commercial flights disrupted. Affected airports included Miami International Airport, which is an American Airlines hub, and airports serving Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and Orlando, Florida. The regulator said, in a statement on Thursday, it is now requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle during launch operations on March 6. During the event, the FAA said, it activated a Debris Response Area and briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling or stopped aircraft at their departure location. Normal operations have resumed. SpaceX said, in a post on X on Thursday night: During Starships ascent burn, the vehicle experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly and contact was lost. Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses. The Elon Musk-led aerospace and defense contractor also said it plans to review the data from todays flight test to better understand the root cause of the mishap. Starship took off from the companys spaceport near Brownsville, Texas, at 6:30 p.m. ET for its eighth test flight. In a livestream showing the test flight, several engines appeared to cut out as the upper-stage Starship vehicle was still climbing. The company then lost communication with the spacecraft but was able to successfully use the arms of its launch tower to catch the rockets Super Heavy Booster. On Jan. 16, dozens of flights were diverted after SpaceXs Starship rocket broke up, and the FAA warned of space vehicle debris falling. The regulator had warned pilots of dangerous area for falling debris of rocket Starship. Commercial airlines, private planes and the space industry compete for airspace, particularly in the congested area off of Florida. SpaceX was working on a mishap investigation into what caused the earlier incident but was allowed by the FAA to proceed with the eighth test flight before completing the inquiry. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for further information. The tallest and most powerful rocket ever launched, Starship is critical to SpaceXs ambitions. When it is stacked on the Super Heavy booster, Starship stands 403 feet tall and is about 30 feet in diameter. SpaceX founder Musk is also a senior Trump advisor, tasked by the president with making sweeping cuts to government agencies. His reach into regulatory agencies, including the FAA, has drawn criticism and concern from Democratic lawmakers worried about conflicts of interest, security risks and more.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/faa-halts-flights-florida-airports-spacex-starsship-testing-failure.html,2025-03-08
Walgreens to go private in roughly $10 billion deal with Sycamore Partners,"In this article Struggling drugstore chain Walgreens is going private.

Sycamore will pay 11.45 per share in cash for Walgreens, representing a roughly 8 premium to the stocks closing price on Thursday. Shareholders could also receive up to 3 more per share in the future from sales of Walgreens primary-care businesses, including Village Medical, Summit Health and CityMD. Walgreens said the total value of the transaction would be up to 23.7 billion when including debt and possible payouts down the line. Walgreens and Sycamore expect to close the take-private deal in the fourth quarter of this year. Shares of Walgreens jumped more than 5 in after-hours trading on Thursday before being halted. The historic deal ends Walgreens tumultuous run as a public company, which began in 1927. As of Thursday morning, shares of the company were up more than 15 for 2025, but the stock was still down more than 48 for the last year and had fallen 70 for the past three years. While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company, Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth, who stepped into the role in 2023, said in a release on Thursday. Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds. Stefan Kaluzny, Sycamores managing director, said in the release the transaction reflects the firms confidence in Walgreens pharmacy-led model and essential role in driving better outcomes for patients, customers and communities. Walgreens will maintain its headquarters in Chicago. The company currently has more than 310,000 employees globally and 12,500 retail pharmacy locations across the U.S., Europe and Latin America, according to the release. Walgreens still plans to release its second-quarter earnings on April 8. Walgreenss market value reached a peak of more than 100 billion in 2015 as investors gained confidence in its health-care business and expansion plans, making it one of the most prominent American retail companies. But the companys market cap shrank to under 8 billion in late 2024 due to competition from its main rival CVS, grocery chains, big-box retailers and Amazon, along with a slew of challenges. Walgreens has been squeezed by the transition out of the Covid pandemic, pharmacy reimbursement headwinds, softer consumer spending and a troubled push into health care. Both Walgreens and CVS have pivoted from years of store expansions to shuttering hundreds of retail pharmacy locations across the U.S. to shore up profits. But unlike CVS, which has diversified its business model by offering insurance and pharmacy benefits, Walgreens largely doubled down on its now-flailing retail pharmacy business.

"Gap shares spike 17% as retailer blows away expectations again, showing turnaround has staying power","In this article Gap on Thursday posted another quarter that blew away expectations, indicating its turnaround under CEO Richard Dickson is working better  and faster  than Wall Street anticipated. Shares jumped 17 in extended trading Thursday. The apparel retailer behind Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner beat expectations on the top and bottom lines during the all-important holiday quarter and saw comparable sales grow 3, ahead of expectations of up 1, according to StreetAccount. Heres how Gap did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The companys reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was 206 million, or 54 cents per share, compared with 185 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales dropped to 4.15 billion, down about 3 from 4.30 billion a year earlier. Like other retailers, Gap benefited from an extra selling week in the year-ago period, which negatively skewed comparisons. In the year ahead, Gap is expecting sales to grow between 1 and 2, in line with expectations of up 1.7, according to LSEG. For the current quarter, its guidance was slightly weaker than anticipated. Its expecting sales to be flat to up slightly, compared to Wall Street estimates of up 1.5, according to LSEG. Weve been operating in a highly dynamic backdrop for the last few years, and were expecting the same for fiscal 2025, said Gaps finance chief Katrina OConnell on a call with analysts. As a result, weve taken a balanced view with our guidance and remain focused on controlling the controllables. Like other retailers caught in the midst of President Donald Trumps trade war with China, Canada and Mexico, Gap has been working to figure out the impact new duties will have on the company. In an interview with CNBC, Dickson said less than 1 of its product comes from Canada and Mexico, combined, and less than 10 comes from China. When asked if the company will raise prices, Dickson said the goal is to minimize the impact to the consumer. Were going to be working with our suppliers. Were looking at our cost base, and well need to balance that with always protecting the structural economics of the business, said Dickson. OConnell added tariffs, as they stood on Thursday, were embedded into the companys guidance and said any impact to margin is expected to be relatively minimal. Its been about a year and a half since Dickson took over as Gaps CEO. Under his direction, the company has gotten back to growth and repaired its brand image  and in fiscal 2024, delivered its highest gross margin in more than 20 years at 41.3. The former Mattel executive, credited with reviving the Barbie empire, has brought that same prowess to revitalizing Gaps brands. After a fourth straight quarter of strong results, it appears the strategy has staying power.

"Costco reports mixed second-quarter earnings, comparable sales growth","In this article Costco on Thursday reported an earnings miss, but beat expectations for revenue for the second quarter as quarterly comparable sales rose. Shares ticked down over 1 in extended trading on Thursday evening. Heres how the wholesale company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the quarter ended Feb. 16, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Costco CEO Ron Vachris said although its difficult to forecast the impact of tariffs, the company aims to minimize cost increases for members. A third of its U.S. sales are from imports, he said, and less than half of those come from China, Mexico and Canada. In uncertain times, our members have historically placed even greater importance on the value of high-quality items at great prices, and our teams will continue to rise to this challenge by leveraging our global buying power, strong supplier relationships and innovation, Vachris said. Citing tariff implications for groceries specifically, Vachris said margins are much tighter in that area, but that Costco will work with suppliers to mitigate the fallout for consumers. President Donald Trump imposed 25 tariffs on Mexico and Canada and doubled his tariff on China to 20 this week, though the White House said Thursday that the U.S. will exempt goods that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade until April 2. Retailers like Target and Best Buy have warned that tariffs would likely lead to price increases. Costcos second-quarter revenue increased 9 to 63.72 billion, from 58.44 billion during the same quarter in fiscal 2024. Net sales for the quarter rose 9.1 to 62.53 billion, compared to 57.33 billion in the year-ago period. Membership fees for the quarter totaled 1.19 billion, up from 1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with the company reporting 78.4 million paid memberships and 140.6 million total cardholders. Worldwide, Costcos membership renewal rate came in at 90.5, an increase of 0.1 from last quarter. The retailer raised its annual membership fees for the U.S. and Canada in September for the first time since 2017, though CFO Gary Millerchip said the impact of the increase on this quarters fee total was only 3. Costco reported a net income for the second quarter of 1.79 billion, or 4.02 per share, compared with a net income of 1.74 billion, or 3.92 per share, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Quarterly comparable sales, which Costco defines as sales from warehouses and e-commerce sites open for more than a year, rose 6.8 year over year, compared with the StreetAccount estimate of 6.4, and were up 8.3 in the U.S. Comparable sales for e-commerce rose 20.9 year over year. On a monthly basis, comparable sales growth did fall from 7.5 in January to 6.5 in February. Extreme weather last month caused some hits here and there, Vachris said, but the company recovered most of that lost business. Shopping traffic grew 5.7 year over year, with an increase of 5.6 in the U.S. The companys top sales c...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/costco-cost-q2-2025-earnings.html,2025-03-08
"Applebee's owner Dine Brands to lean on value, marketing to reverse sales declines","In this article Dine Brands hopes to boost sales this year with a wider swath of value meals and buzzier advertising after a rough 2024 for Applebees and IHOP. We had a soft year in 2024, which disappoints us, but were focused on improving that in 2025, Dine Brands CEO John Peyton told CNBC. Weve got to have compelling messages and compelling promotions and compelling reasons to drive traffic into the restaurants. Dine on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter U.S. same-store sales dropped 4.7 at Applebees and 2.8 at IHOP, ending the year with four straight quarters of domestic same-store sales declines for its two flagship brands. Shares of Dine have fallen 50 over the last 12 months, dragging its market cap down to 386 million. The companys down year followed three years of strong growth for the company, driven by pent-up demand as diners returned to IHOP and Applebees after the pandemic. But like many restaurant companies, Dine saw a pullback last year from customers who make less than 75,000. After several years paying higher prices for groceries, rent, gas and other necessities, consumers opted to stay home to cook their meals or visit other chains that offered better deals or flashy promotions. The slowdown in restaurant spending led a slew of casual-dining restaurant chains to file for bankruptcy over the last 12 months. Familiar names like Red Lobster and TGI Fridays sought bankruptcy protection to reorganize their struggling businesses and offload their worst-performing restaurants. Most recently, On the Border filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday. Applebees promotions have failed to cut through much of the noise from the so-called value wars that have ignited across the restaurant industry, at chains from McDonalds to Bloomin Brands Outback Steakhouse. Even a triad of recent pop-culture moments last year couldnt boost its profile: a pivotal cameo in the tennis drama film Challengers, an Applebees-motivated meltdown on Survivor and a shoutout from football legend Peyton Manning during Netflixs roast of his former rival Tom Brady. Youve got most of the restaurant companies are advertising value, and theyre advertising full meal deals, and so its harder to break through with a message when there are so many similar messages out there, Dines Peyton said. But its not impossible to break out from the pack. Chilis, which is owned by Brinker International, won over diners with its viral Triple Dipper and 10.99 burger combo after spending months turning around its business. In its most recent quarter, Brinker reported same-store sales growth of 27.4. Thanks to its dramatic comeback, the company has become the rare casual-dining darling of investors. Brinkers stock has soared over the last year, nearly tripling its value in the same period and raising its market cap to 6.29 billion. For now, the star of Applebees value promotions, the two for 25 deal, routinely accounts for roughly a fifth of the chains tickets, according to Peyton. But Applebee...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/applebees-owner-dine-brands-to-lean-on-value-to-reverse-sales-declines.html,2025-03-08
Women's pro tennis introduces paid maternity leave funded by Saudi sovereign wealth fund,"Big changes are coming to professional womens tennis. The Womens Tennis Association and Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund have launched a new program to provide players with maternity and child family planning benefits, the organizations said Thursday. Womens tennis is one of the last professional sports to provide these benefits, and players have been asking. As part of the program, eligible players will receive up to 12 months of paid maternity leave. Players will also have access to grants to cover fertility conception and egg freezing treatments. The WTA said the new policy will benefit 320 eligible players. This initiative will provide the current and next generation of players the support and flexibility to explore family life, in whatever form they choose, Portia Archer, WTA CEO, said in a statement. The PIF WTA maternity fund program is the first and only maternity program in womens sports to be fully funded and supported by an external partner, the WTA said. PIF declined to comment on how much it is contributing to this program, but the organizations said players will be compensated equally. In May, the Saudi public investment fund and the WTA agreed to a multiyear partnership as Saudi Arabia looks to further its investment into sports. PIF also funds the LIV Golf league. The partnership has drawn criticism from some current and former players due to Saudi Arabias history of human rights abuses. The new policy could be an attempt by the PIF to show U.S. tennis fans that the Kingdom is changing. PIF partnerships are designed to elevate every level of sport and leave a legacy of transformative impact on a global scale, said Alanoud Althonayan, head of events and sponsorships at PIF, in a statement. While the changes signal a positive step for womens tennis, the sport is following in the footsteps of other professional womens sports as maternity benefits have emerged as a key issue for players in recent years. Thinking back about my experience in 2008 when I had my daughter, there was no support, said Kim Clijsters, former WTA No. 1 player and a PIF Ambassador, in a statement. I think this is going to be a career-changing opportunity for a lot of players. The Womens National Basketball Associations latest collective bargaining agreement with players guarantees women full pay during maternity leave. FIFA and the National Womens Soccer League also recently expanded their maternity benefits. Thursdays announcement has been a long time coming for former top-ranked star Victoria Azarenka. She has been advocating for maternity pay in tennis since giving birth to her son in 2016. Azarenka sits on the players council advocating for increased benefits. This marks the beginning of a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis, making it easier for athletes to pursue both their careers and their aspirations of starting a family, Azarenka said in a statement.

Macy's turnaround hinges on revamping some stores and closing others. It appears to be working,"In this article Macys delivered another quarter of mixed results on Thursday as investors wait and see how quickly CEO Tony Spring can pull off a turnaround of the business with yet another activist investor looking to take the chain private. Across the business, which includes the Macys banner, Bloomingdales and Blue Mercury, comparable sales during the all-important holiday quarter were down 1.1. But comparable sales across its owned and licensed businesses, plus its online marketplace, were up 0.2, which is the highest the metric has been since the first quarter of 2022. Plus, the so-called First 50 locations  the stores that Macys is devoting more resources to as part of its turnaround plan  saw comparable sales up 0.8, marking the fourth quarter in a row the metric has been positive. The two bright spots in an otherwise worse-than-expected set of results suggest Macys turnaround is showing some signs of life  it just might not be working fast enough. For fiscal 2025, Macys is expecting adjusted earnings per share of 2.05 to 2.25 and sales of between 21 billion and 21.4 billion, lower than Wall Street expectations of 2.31 per share and 21.8 billion, according to LSEG. Macys shares fell slightly in early trading. Heres how the department store performed during its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The companys reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was 342 million, or 1.21 per share, compared with a loss of 128 million, or a loss of 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items including impairments and settlement and restructuring charges, Macys reported earnings of 507 million, or 1.80 per share. Sales dropped to 7.77 billion, down about 4 from 8.12 billion a year earlier. Like other retailers, Macys benefited from an extra selling week in the year-ago period, which has skewed comparisons. For the current quarter, Macys is expecting adjusted earnings per share of between 12 cents and 15 cents and sales of between 4.4 billion and 4.5 billion, far below estimates of 28 cents and 4.71 billion, according to LSEG. On a call with analysts, chief operating officer and chief financial officer Adrian Mitchell said the company is taking a prudent approach to guidance given the fluid nature of the turnaround plan, cautious consumer spending and uncertainties created by recent tariff increases between the U.S. and major trade partners. If we werent in the environment that were operating in, I would be even more bullish on our potential, CEO Spring said during a call with analysts. But I think prudency is important at this point in time. Macys mixed results come just over a year into Springs tenure as the legacy department stores chief executive and his three-year strategy to turn the business around. While Bloomingdales and Blue Mercury saw another quarter of positive comparable sales, growing 4.8 and 6.2, respectively, Macys namesake ba...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/macys-m-q4-2024-earnings.html,2025-03-08
"Rare Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant rookie jerseys expected to sell for $20 million at auction","Rare pieces of memorabilia from two of the National Basketball Associations biggest icons are hitting the auction block and are expected to sell for a combined 20 million. Sothebys announced on Thursday that it is putting up for auction Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant rookie jerseys that were worn during each of their first NBA games. The auction comes as rookie memorabilia has seen a recent surge in popularity and pricing. The historical weight of these two jerseys is difficult to overstate. They are as rare as they come, said Brahm Wachter, Sothebys head of modern collectables, in a statement. The jerseys will be available in separate lots beginning March 21. The Jordan jersey was first worn Oct. 5, 1984, in Peoria, Illinois, where he played his first game for the Chicago Bulls in front of a crowd of just 2,000 people. Sothebys said jerseys from Jordans rookie season are unicorns and rarely seen on the market. Jordan ended up averaging 28.2 points per game that rookie season, earning him Rookie of the Year honors. He went on to win six NBA championships and has cemented his name as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Sothebys expects the iconic jersey to fetch about 10 million. A second lot is offering Bryants first jersey from his 1996-97 rookie reason with the Los Angeles Lakers. Sothebys said the rare jersey was worn during Bryants first preseason and regular season games. Bryant entered the NBA at just 18 years old and went on to win five NBA championships and two Finals MVP awards. He died in a tragic helicopter crash in 2020. Bryants jersey is also expected to sell in the 10 million range. Sothebys says rookie memorabilia has seen a recent uptick in demand among its customers. In October 2023, Victor Wembanyamas game-worn San Antonio Spurs jersey sold for 762,000, and in August 2022, a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card sold for 12.6 million. Early rookie jerseys represent the genesis of an athletes career. For collectors in search of true one-of-one treasures, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own iconic pieces of basketball history, said Wachter.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/michael-jordan-kobe-bryant-rookie-jerseys-auction.html,2025-03-08
Trump grants automakers one-month exemption from tariffs,"In this article The White House on Wednesday announced a one-month North American tariff exemption for automakers after President Donald Trump spoke a day earlier with heads of General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis. Automakers have urged Trump to waive 25 tariffs on Mexico and Canada on vehicles that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreements trade rules of origin. Reciprocal tariffs will still go into effect on April 2, but at the request of the companies associated with USMCA, the president is giving them an exemption for one month so they are not at an economic disadvantage, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on behalf of Trump. The American Automotive Policy Council, a trade group representing the Big 3 Detroit automakers, applauded Trumps decision recognizing that vehicles and parts that meet the high US and regional USMCA content requirements should be exempt from these tariffs. Leavitt said the president is open to hearing requests from other industries seeking exemptions as well. Leavitt also confirmed the Big 3 Detroit automakers requested the Tuesday call with Trump, who mentioned it during his address to Congress later in the day. Two sources on Wednesday confirmed to CNBC that GM CEO Mary Barra, Stellantis Chairman John Elkann, Ford CEO Jim Farley and Ford Chair Bill Ford participated in the call. The White House said it granted a one-month delay for tariffs on automakers whose cars comply with USMCA, which was negotiated under Trumps first term in office. Shares of GM, Ford and Stellantis were notably up following the announcement. Stellantis closed Wednesday up 9.2, followed by GM up 7.2 and Ford higher by 5.8. The White House confirmed Thursday that the one-month exemption includes automotive parts, accessories and other supplier products in addition to completed vehicles. Its unclear how much if any input Tesla CEO Elon Musk had on the tariffs or the delay. After campaigning for Trump, Musk has been one of his closest advisors and a nearly constant presence by his side. The exemption allows for additional preparation and discussions between the White House and automotive industry on tariffs. It also more closely aligns with potential vehicle tariffs on imports from outside of North America. Trump previously said those tariffs would be confirmed on April 2, in a push for automakers to invest more in the U.S. for vehicle production. Were going to have growth in the auto industry like nobodys ever seen, Trump said Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. Thats a combination of the election win and tariffs. Trump erroneously touted a new plant investment in Indiana for Honda Motor during his speech Tuesday night. The company operates a large assembly plant in the state, but its most recent major investments have been in Ohio. Honda on Wednesday thanked the president for acknowledging the company, but confirmed it did not announce plans for a new plant in the U.S. at this time.

These are the most competitive rental markets in the U.S.,"New apartment construction hit a record high last year, but all that new supply is apparently not enough to cool the competition in the market. Getting a rental is actually becoming even more difficult, according to a new report from RentCafe, an apartment search site. Last year, developers completed close to 600,000 multifamily units, according to the U.S. Census. That is the highest level since 1974 and a 34 increase from 2023. New York City, Dallas and Austin, Texas, led in the number of new rentals. Despite that, on a national level, rental competitiveness rose at the start of this year, according to RentCafes Rental Competitiveness Index. Thats in large part because a growing number of renters are not moving. Lease renewal rates rose to 63.1 in the early part of this year, compared with 61.5 in the early part of last year, according to RentCafe. Much of that is likely due to higher mortgage rates and elevated prices in the for-sale housing market. Apartment occupancy is also holding firm at 93.3, slightly higher than at the beginning of last year. In addition, landlords are offering longer lease periods, which then lead to extended renewal periods, according to the report. As a result, each available apartment has an average of seven applicants. Looking locally, Miami has the highest occupancy rate. It is the most competitive, with an average 14 applicants for each unit. Throughout the last few years, Miami has established itself as Wall Street South, attracting major banking institutions and investment firms, while existing industries like tech and healthcare continue to grow, bringing in more workers, wrote Veronica Grecu, senior creative writer and researcher for RentCafe, in the report. Plus, Miamis lack of income tax and its location at the crossroads of the Americas remain major draws for professionals and businesses. The Midwest, however, leads in overall rental competitiveness. Ten of the top 20 hottest rental markets are in the region, with suburban Chicago coming in second behind Miami. Others include Detroit, Lansing and Grand Rapids in Michigan, as well as Cincinnati; Milwaukee; and Minneapolis-St. Paul in Minnesota. Rents, which had been easing, are now on the rise again. Nationwide, rents increased 0.3 in February, the first monthly advance in rents following six consecutive months of declines, according to ApartmentList. February is the start of the historically busy season in the rental market, and rents are expected to rise throughout the summer. Rents are still 0.4 lower than they were in February of last year, however. Following a period of record-setting rent growth in 2021 and the first half of 2022, the national median rent has now fallen below its August 2022 peak by a total of 4.6, or 67 per month, according to ApartmentList. The typical rent price, however, is still 20 higher than it was in January 2021. Year-over-year rent growth has now been negative since June 2023, but in recent months, there are signs that a ret...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/most-competitive-rental-united-states.html,2025-03-08
Abercrombie & Fitch shares plunge 15% after star retailer posts weak guidance for year ahead,"In this article Abercrombie  Fitchs growth story is starting to slow down. Shares of the apparel retailer plummeted 15 on Wednesday after the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for its current quarter and fiscal 2025, and said it expects its sales will grow more slowly than Wall Street anticipated. Abercrombie is expecting sales to rise between 3 and 5 in fiscal 2025, well below estimates of 6.8 growth, according to LSEG. During its current quarter, the company anticipates earnings per share will be between 1.25 and 1.45, short of expectations of 1.97. A slowdown at Abercrombies namesake brand is compounding concerns. The segment had been leading the companys growth in prior quarters more than Hollister, its chain that caters more to teenagers. During the quarter, sales at Abercrombie grew just 2, while Hollister sales jumped 16. Comparable sales at Abercrombie rose 5, while Hollister comps spiked 24. Abercrombie brand sales continued to decelerate into February and turned negative for the month, CEO Fran Horowitz said on a call with analysts. Last year we did have a bit of a flawless transition into spring, and this year its a bit more normalized. The full companys sales are positive for the month of February, seeing a little bit of a difference between the brands. Hollister came in very strong off of a very, very strong Q4 and Abercrombie is a bit negative, Horowitz said. When asked where macroeconomic conditions or something else is driving that slowdown, executives didnt really answer and said instead theyre seeing green shoots for spring. Beyond guidance and slowing growth, Abercrombie narrowly beat Wall Streets expectations in its fiscal fourth quarter. Heres how the retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The companys reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was 187 million, or 3.57 per share, compared with 158 million, or 2.97 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to 1.58 billion, up 9 from 1.45 billion a year earlier. Like other retailers, Abercrombie benefited from an extra selling week in the year-ago period. That negatively skewed comparisons for many companies, but Abercrombie sales jumped even with one less selling week. Beyond sales and earnings, Abercrombie said it expects another key metric  operating margin  to be lower than Wall Street anticipated in the current quarter. Abercrombie is expecting its operating margin to be in a range of between 8 and 9, well behind estimates of 12.8, according to StreetAccount. In January, Abercrombie offered investors a glimpse into its holiday performance when it released an early set of results and raised its fourth-quarter outlook. Still, its stock tumbled that day because the forecast showed that Abercrombie was expecting its growth to moderate and thought its operating margin would not increase beyond its previous forecast.

Novo Nordisk offers Wegovy for less than half the price through new direct-to-consumer pharmacy,"In this article Novo Nordisk on Wednesday said it will offer its weight loss drug Wegovy for less than half of its usual price per month through a new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy. The cash-pay offering is available to millions of patients without insurance coverage for the blockbuster injection. It aims to make Wegovy available to more people, while also ensuring that patients use the branded medication instead of cheaper compounded copycats that exploded in popularity during a recently resolved U.S. shortage of Novo Nordisks drug. The pharmacy, called NovoCare, will allow patients to pay 499 in cash per month for the weekly drug. Wegovys list price before insurance and other rebates is almost 1,350 per month. The site can also ship Wegovy prescriptions directly to patients homes through a specialty pharmacy partner. NovoCare will also offer refill reminders and access to live support from a case manager at the company, among other patient support services. Patients and prescribers alike have another option that provides convenient access to all doses of real, FDA-approved Wegovy at a reduced cost in our high-quality pen, Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development, said in a statement. Notably, the company said in the near future it will extend the new savings offer for Wegovy to cash-paying patients who use traditional retail pharmacies so they can also pay a lower price. The Danish drugmakers move follows a similar strategy from its main rival Eli Lilly. The two companies are fighting to dominate the market for so-called GLP-1s, which mimic certain gut hormones to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar. Eli Lilly in January 2024 launched its own direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, LillyDirect, to help patients access its weight loss drug Zepbound. The website allows eligible patients to get a prescription through a telehealth provider and can provide home delivery. More recently, LillyDirect also started offering Zepbound in single-dose vials that are half or even less than its usual 1,000 monthly list price. In recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has declared the U.S. shortages of both Zepbound and Wegovy over. That decision will prevent certain compounding pharmacies from creating unapproved versions of the injections. NovoCare helps patients avoid the significant risks that can be posed by the compounding marketplace, as warned by respected organizations, experts in the medical community, and the FDA, Novo Nordisk said in a statement.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/novo-nordisk-offers-discounted-wegovy-through-direct-to-consumer-pharmacy.html,2025-03-08
Amgen starts two critical late-stage trials for weight loss drug MariTide,"Amgen on Wednesday said it has started two critical late-stage trials for its experimental weight loss injection MariTide, another step in its bid to enter the booming obesity drug market. Were delighted to share that these trials have now been initiated, and really, the progression of the MARITIME program is going very, very well, Dr. Jay Bradner, Amgens executive vice president of research and development, said during a TD Cowen conference, using the name of the drugs phase three development program. MariTide is a monthly injection that investors hope could compete against existing weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which are weekly injectables. They are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1s, which mimic certain hormones produced in the gut to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar. About 6 of U.S. adults, or more than 15 million people, were using a prescription for GLP-1s as of May, according to a survey from health policy organization KFF. Some analysts expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth more than 150 billion annually by the early 2030s. One of the new phase three trials is examining Amgens drug in around 3,500 people with obesity or who are overweight without Type 2 diabetes, Bradner said. The second study examines MariTide in 999 patients who are obese or overweight and have Type 2 diabetes The main goal of both studies is to measure the percentage of weight loss at 72 weeks. Amgen will study three target doses of MariTide and plans to use dose escalation, or starting patients at a lower dose of the drug and increasing that amount over time. The company did not share a specific regimen for dosing in the trials. Amgen in November said MariTide helped patients with obesity lose up to 20 of their weight on average after a year in a phase two trial, with no weight loss plateau. The drug also helped patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes lose up to 17 of their weight after a year with no plateau. But the results were on the lower end of Wall Streets lofty expectations for the drug. Amgen will report more data on MariTide this year. The full results of the phase two trial will be presented at the American Diabetes Association conference in June. The company is also continuing to study patients in an extension of that trial that will read out in the second half of this year. MariTide brings a new approach to weight loss compared with the existing drugs on the market because it is a so-called peptide antibody conjugate, which refers to a monoclonal antibody linked to two peptides. The peptides activate receptors of a gut hormone called GLP-1, while the antibody blocks receptors of another hormone called GIP. Thats unlike Eli Lillys obesity drug, Zepbound, which activates both GIP and GLP-1. Novo Nordisks Wegovy activates GLP-1 but does not target GIP, which may also affect how the body breaks down sugar and fat.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/amgen-weight-loss-drug-maritide-starts-two-phase-three-trials.html,2025-03-08
"David's Bridal taps new CEO as it looks to become media company, build online marketplace","Davids Bridal has tapped a new CEO to lead the company as it looks to transform from a legacy retailer into a bridal media powerhouse nearly two years after emerging from its second bankruptcy. Kelly Cook, the current president of brand, technology and finance, will take over as Davids CEO on April 1 and will become just the second woman in the companys 75-year history to hold its top job. As part of Cooks appointment as chief executive, current CEO Jim Marcum will become Davids executive chairman, in addition to his current role as chairman of the board. In an interview with CNBC, Cook outlined her vision for the company and the work shes doing to bring Davids into the future. At the heart of the new strategy is positioning Davids as a media company that uses content to bring customers in and then uses that data to drive advertising revenue for its newly launched Pearl Media Network. On the retail side of the business, Davids plans to build out an online marketplace and become an asset-lite business that relies on a network of vendors to create products and fulfill orders. So we already sell about a third of the wedding dresses in the United States  the bridal dress is what we do, its who we are, but we are expanding the shopping side of it to include more categories that shes asking for, mens suits, mens wear, rentals, swimwear, occasion dresses, party dresses, said Cook. All of that is being added through a drop ship marketplace model and that allows us to add vendors very, very quickly, it allows us to scale very, very quickly  versus in the past, where we would have to build more stores and add more square footage. Davids efforts to transform come nearly two years after it emerged from a pandemic-induced bankruptcy that nearly ended its business. It managed to keep around 200 stores open after receiving a no-cash bid from asset manager Cion Investment Corp.  the only firm willing to acquire Davids stores and inventory, not just its brand name and intellectual property, reports said previously. Now, Davids is attracting a new slate of investors and said Tuesday it has received capital commitments from a number of firms, including private equity platforms and those that offer debt. It declined to name the firms, but said the new capital will be used to fuel the companys transformation. Cook said the company was able to woo investors by touting its new take on bridal retail. Currently, Davids manufactures about 90 to 95 of its inventory, but its aiming to get the business down to a 5050 split between its own manufacturing and outside vendors, said Cook. This transition into an asset-lite model will help shield the company from the existential risks that pushed it into bankruptcy twice before  inventory and store leases  which can be some of the biggest burdens on a companys balance sheet. Plus, its following behind the likes of Walmart in its expansion into advertising, or so-called retail media, which is a way for relevant brands to advertise ...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/davids-bridal-taps-new-ceo-plans-to-build-online-marketplace.html,2025-03-08
NHL commissioner says league could be affected by U.S.-Canada tariffs,"National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday that the league could be affected by the current tensions between the U.S. and Canada. Bettman said 25 of the leagues revenue comes from its Canadian clubs. Though he said the Canadian teams perform well, Bettman added that there could be ramifications for the league depending on the state of Canadian tariffs. All players, no matter which country they play in, get paid in U.S. dollars, Bettman told CNBCs Becky Quick on Squawk Box. So if the impact of the tariffs is to see the Canadian dollar drop relative to the U.S. dollar, it will make it more difficult and more painful. Bettman said he has not yet engaged in any conversations with the Trump administration, but he believes the core of the tension between the two countries is a policy issue, with Canadians and Americans getting caught in the middle. Im hoping that this is a moment in time and both countries find a way to work through this, Bettman said, adding that the uncertainty and tariffs may also cause difficulties with the NHLs sponsors. The league currently has seven Canadian teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks. Despite the uncertainty, Bettman said the league is expecting to exceed revenue of 7 billion in mixed currency for the current 2024-25 season. The NHL has also seen record ratings and strong attendance, he noted, with teams playing at 96.7 capacity season to date. According to CNBCs 2024 Official NHL Team Valuations, the average NHL franchise value was 1.92 billion. Our ratings are strong and we have great media partners in Canada and the United States, Bettman said. And were in a good place because the game has never been better.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/nhl-commissioner-gary-bettman-us-canada-tariffs.html,2025-03-08
Foot Locker results show the sneaker industry — and Nike — still have more pain ahead,"In this article Foot Locker said Wednesday it expects another year of deep discounts in the sneaker industry as its largest brand partner Nike continues its reset and relies on markdowns to clear through stale inventory. The footwear giant delivered mix results for its holiday quarter, beating Wall Streets expectations on earnings but falling short on sales. In the year ahead, it anticipates that trend will reverse. For fiscal 2025, Foot Locker is expecting profits to be lower than Wall Street estimated, while the high end of its comparable sales guidance is better than analysts had forecast, according to LSEG and StreetAccount. Shares rose more than 4 in early trading. Heres how Foot Locker performed in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The companys reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was 49 million, or 51 cents per share, compared with a loss of 389 million, or 4.13 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to impairment charges and net losses from discontinued operations, Foot Locker reported adjusted earnings per share of 82 million, or 86 cents per share. Sales dropped to 2.25 billion, down nearly 6 from 2.38 billion a year earlier. In the year-ago period, Foot Locker  like other retailers  benefited from an extra week, which has skewed comparison results. While Foot Locker improved profits by more than 100 compared with the prior quarter, its not expecting that trend to continue in its current fiscal year, thanks to deep promotional activity across the sneaker marketplace. Its expecting adjusted earnings per share to be between 1.35 and 1.65, well behind Wall Street estimates of 1.77, according to LSEG. Meanwhile, its projecting comparable sales to rise between 1 and 2.5, which at the high end beats expectations of up 1.9, according to StreetAccount. While we expect consumer and category promotional pressures to remain uncertain into 2025, especially within the first half, our Lace Up Plan strategies continue to resonate with our customers and brand partners, CEO Mary Dillon said in a statement. Our return to positive comparable sales growth, gross margin expansion, and positive free cash flow in fiscal 2024 serve as proof points that our Lace Up Plan is working. Foot Lockers expectations that promotional pressures will weigh on margins in the year ahead indicates that its still having issues with Nike, its largest brand partner. The sneaker giant is in the midst of a turnaround under its new CEO Elliott Hill, and said previously its relying on deep discounts to clear out inventory. When Nike is promotional, it impacts Foot Lockers business because the brand still represents about 60 of sales. In December, Hill outlined his strategy to return Nike to growth and said deep discounting was to blame for declining revenue and profit. The company is aiming to drive full-price sales on its website, but first, it said it ne...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/foot-locker-fl-q4-2024-earnings.html,2025-03-08
"Kenvue settles proxy fight with activist Starboard, adding three directors to its board","In this article Kenvue settled its proxy fight with activist Starboard Value, adding three new directors to its board. Starboards Jeff Smith will join the board of the Johnson  Johnson spinoff, along with Sarah Hofstetter, president of Profitero, an e-commerce performance analytics platform, and Erica Mann, former head of pharmaceutical company Bayers consumer health division. Sarahs brand building and digital marketing expertise, Ericas global consumer health industry experience, and Jeffs investor perspective and extensive service on corporate boards will further strengthen the Board with complementary, value-additive skillsets, said Larry Merlo, chair of Kenvues board, in a statement Wednesday. CNBC reported in October that Starboard had amassed a significant stake in the company and expressed disappointment in its management and share price performance. Kenvue is the maker of iconic brands familiar to both investors and the broader public, such as Aveeno, Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena, Tylenol and JJs namesake baby powder and shampoo. JJ completed its separation from Kenvue in August 2023, and has since sold all of its remaining stake in the consumer goods giant.

U.S. Olympic committee announces $100 million grant to fund athletes into their future,"The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee on Wednesday announced a 100 million grant to provide long-term financial support for future Olympic athletes. The gift, the largest donation in the organizations history, comes from Ross Stevens, founder and CEO of asset manager Stone Ridge Holdings Group. It comes as awareness grows of the financial burden that many Olympic athletes face: Rigid training schedules often come at the expense of traditional career paths with financial savings. As part of the gift, every Olympic and Paralympic athlete who participates in the 2026 games in Milan and future games through at least 2032 will receive 200,000 in financial benefits. The six-figure award is paid out per Olympic games that the athlete competes in, and there is no maximum. Because of Ross extraordinary generosity and philanthropic creativity, we can create more than a financial safety net  we can build a springboard that will propel these athletes to even greater heights beyond their Olympic and Paralympic careers, USOPC Chair Gene Sykes said in a statement. There is, however, a catch: The money isnt coming right away. The first 100,000 doesnt kick in for 20 years after the games or until the athlete turns 45, whichever comes later. It will be distributed over four years but can be used for any purpose such as starting a business or supporting their families, the USOPC suggests. The remaining 100,000 will be given to eligible athletes families upon their death. This is an incredible gift that will pay enormous dividends for these athletes later in life, said Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the USOPC. That does not replace the idea of also trying to generate philanthropic funds for athletes now and today, and we are doing that as well. Hirshland said while there are some Olympic athletes raking in big money in endorsement deals, the vast majority of Olympic athletes dont fall into that category. Theres no salary that comes along with these roles, theres certainly no retirement program, she told CNBC. The U.S. is unique in that 100 of the work the USOPC does is privately funded. Many countries have sports ministries that operate and fund their Olympic teams. Some other nations also pay handsome sums for Olympic competitors who bring home a medal. Medalists can earn as much as 750,000 for gold in some jurisdictions. Typically, the U.S. delegation has about 1,200 athletes, among the largest and often by a wide margin. We also have the most successful team in the world and over history, a vastly larger group of competitive athletes than most countries, Hirshland said. So the scale and scope of what we do here is vastly different than many of our peers around the world. Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics.

Here's how tariffs will hit the U.S. housing market,"From lumber to drywall to appliances to finishings, much of what goes into a U.S. home comes from outside American borders. The cost of those products is about to go up, as President Donald Trumps administration imposes tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. Goods from China are now subject to a 20 tax, an increase from a previous 10 tax, and those from Canada and Mexico face a 25 tax. Canadian lumber was already subject to separate duties of 14.5. The new tariffs could increase builder costs anywhere from 7,500 to 10,000 per home, said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, citing estimates from U.S. homebuilders. Last year the NAHB estimated that every 1,000 increase in the median price of a new home prices out roughly 106,000 potential buyers. The greatest impact to homebuilders will be from lumber cost increases, which are expected to total about 4,900 per home on average, according to Leading Builders of America, the trade group representing most of the nations publicly traded homebuilders. Roughly a third of the lumber used in U.S. homebuilding comes from Canada, and domestic lumber producers are expected to raise their prices to match the imported supply. Since Trump first imposed the tariffs on Feb. 1, which were then delayed, weve seen some increase in buying with prices for Western Spruce-Pine-Fir two-by-fours increasing 13, said Paul Jannke, principal at Forest Economic Advisors. With the re-imposition of the 25 tariff on Canadian goods shipped to the U.S., we expect Canadian producers will stop shipping lumber to the U.S. Meanwhile, dealers, who have been hesitant to buy given uncertainty around the tariffs, will need to step up purchases ahead of the coming building season. This will drive prices higher. Lumber futures are up 5 in the past week and were rising steadily Tuesday. Trump on Saturday issued an executive order to increase domestic lumber production through a streamlining of regulatory and permitting processes. The homebuilding industry took that as a win. A stable and affordable supply of lumber is critically important for our industry to address the countrys housing supply crisis, wrote Ken Gear, CEO of the LBA, in a statement. The domestic lumber industry cannot meet current demand, so we applaud President Trump for exploring opportunities to increase domestic supply as a long term solution. The NAHB, which represents small to mid-sized private builders, welcomed the move, but said in a statement, Any additional tariffs on lumber could further increase the cost of construction and discourage new development, and consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices. As for ramping up domestic production immediately, thats easier said than done. Jannke estimates it would take up to three years to build multiple new mills. He explained that there are a limited number of companies that manufacture sawmill machinery and even fewer, perhaps one or two, that can build a mill ...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/how-tariffs-will-hit-the-us-housing-market.html,2025-03-08
Trump's tariffs could quickly cut North American auto production by a third,"DETROIT  Roughly a third of vehicle production in North America could be cut by next week as a result of President Donald Trumps 25 tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as automakers attempt to mitigate increased costs and buyers hold off on purchasing new cars and trucks. That lost production would equate to roughly 20,000 units per day, according to a new analysis from prominent data and forecasting firm SP Global Mobility. The production impact as well as possibility of layoffs would continue to grow if the tariffs, which Trump implemented Tuesday, are not changed or lifted. We have a new dawn, to a degree. This is a significant move, Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at SP Global Mobility, said during a webinar with the Automotive Press Association. SP Global Mobility reports 25 automakers on average produce 63,900 light-duty passenger vehicles in North America per day. A majority of those, roughly 65, are assembled in the U.S., followed by 27 in Mexico and 8 in Canada. The affected production will vary by automaker, vehicle and plant location. It could mean a plant is completely idled or that it produces fewer vehicles that rely on parts that cross borders multiple times in different forms before being installed in a vehicle. I think were going to see some plants drop shifts. Were going to see some plants just slow build rates, Brinley said. It wont be necessarily consistent across automakers. Its going to very much be about what they need and how much they need it. Shares of automotive stocks fell more than the broader market Tuesday as a result of the tariffs. A tariff is a tax on imports, or foreign goods, brought into the United States. The companies importing the goods pay the tariffs, and some experts fear the companies would simply pass any additional costs on to consumers  raising the cost of vehicles and potentially reducing demand. Several automakers this week declined to comment directly on the 25 tariffs, relying on past comments or trade associations to speak on their behalf. The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis  all of which are heavily affected by the tariffs  argues that vehicles and parts that meet the stringent domestic and regional content requirements of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, should be exempt from the tariff increase. Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market, said former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of AAPC, in a statement Monday night. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing the vast majority of automakers selling vehicles in the U.S., warned that no automakers will c...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/trump-tariffs-north-american-auto-production.html,2025-03-08
Southwest Airlines closing 2 crew bases in cost-cutting push,"In this article Southwest Airlines is closing two flight attendant bases amid its cost-cutting push that has also led to its first mass layoffs in its more than 50 years of flying. The airline is closing the satellite bases at Floridas Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and at Texas Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, according to a flight attendant union memo. While the Company is within its rights to make this decision, it is not without impact on Flight Attendants, said TWU Local 556 President Bill Bernal. He said the union and company agreed to move the closure back one month, making it effective on July 1. This allows affected Members more time to make arrangements for this change in their professional and personal lives, Bernal said. The airports are so-called satellite bases for flight attendants, not pilots, and smaller than its main bases. A Southwest spokesman said the carrier opened the bases in early 2018 and that the 280 flight attendants who will be affected can transfer to the 12 main bases. This change will ultimately help strengthen our Crew network and support a more reliable operation for our Employees and Customers, the airline said in a statement. The Dallas-based carrier has been slashing unprofitable routes, affecting hundreds of front-line employees, including in Atlanta. Last month, the airline said it was will cut 15 of corporate staff, or 1,750 people, that would save it about 210 million this year. The moves come after the airline settled last year with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which won five Southwest board seats, short of control. The firm had also pushed for Bob Jordan to be replaced as CEO, though it was not successful.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/southwest-airlines-closing-austin-fort-lauderdale-crew-bases.html,2025-03-08
"CFPB drops lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo over Zelle fraud","In this article The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday dismissed its lawsuit against the operator of the Zelle payments network and the three U.S. banks that dominate transactions on it. The CFPB sued Early Warning Services, which runs the peer-to-peer payments network, as well as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo in December, alleging that the firms failed to properly investigate fraud complaints or give victims reimbursement. The CFPB dismisses this action against Defendants Early Warning Services, LLC, Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., with prejudice, the regulator said in its filing. Since acting Director Russell Vought has taken over the CFPB, the agency has dropped at least a half dozen cases brought by his predecessor, Rohit Chopra. The agency is now embroiled in a legal battle after a union representing CFPB employees sued to halt mass firings and the purging of data that wouldve happened under Vought and Elon Musks Department of Government Efficiency. The CFPB said customers of the three banks have lost more than 870 million since the launch of Zelle in 2017. The service was started to provide bank customers an alternative to peer-to-peer platforms including PayPal. Last year Zelle crossed 1 trillion in total volume, which it said was the most ever for a peer-to-peer platform. Since the recent cases were dismissed with prejudice, the CFPB has agreed to never bring these claims again, shutting off the possibility of clawing back funds for consumer relief, former head of enforcement Eric Halperin told CNBC last week. A spokeswoman for the Zelle brand said they welcomed the dismissal and reiterated an assertion that the CFPB lawsuit was legally and factually flawed. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said that while banks play a crucial role in scam prevention and consumer education.... this is a national security problem that requires a collective effort across the public and private sectors. Banks have consistently followed the law in offering services through Zelle, Lindsey Johnson, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement after the dismissal. In a time when fraud and scam activity is surging ... we look forward to moving past finger-pointing and political grandstanding and instead working constructively with policymakers to counter the root causes of these threats.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/cfpb-drops-jpmorgan-bank-of-america-wells-fargo-lawsuit.html,2025-03-08
"Target to expand online marketplace, boost product assortment as it aims for $15 billion in sales growth by 2030","In this article Target plans to double down on its third-party marketplace, media network and same day delivery services to drive more than 15 billion in revenue growth over the next five years, it said Tuesday at an investor meeting in New York City. The retailers plans to grow its business and better compete against rivals like Walmart and Amazon come as Target finds itself in a rough patch, struggling to grow sales of high-margin discretionary merchandise and reclaim its competitive advantage. Shares of Target fell more than 5 in early trading on Tuesday after the company issued its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter earnings and told investors its expecting to see a meaningful drop in profits during its current quarter because of soft sales in February. As of Mondays close, shares of the company are down nearly 11 this year. In the companys presentation to investors and analysts, Target outlined a robust growth strategy to reclaim the so-called Tarzhay magic that has long made it a favorite among consumers. The company is aiming to improve the store experience, introduce new and exciting products and invest in its supply chain to make it more efficient. In prepared remarks, CEO Brian Cornell touted the companys plans to grow its third-party marketplace so it can offer a wider range of items to consumers. The strategy takes a page out from Walmart, which has looked to mimic Amazons model to boost revenue. Both of the legacy retailers are turning to digital sales  and the unlimited supply that comes from third-party sellers  as paths to growth as more consumers shop online and they run out of space to build new stores. In a press release, Target said it plans to dramatically expand the size of its marketplace and grow third-party digital sales from about 1 billion in 2024 to more than 5 billion in 2030. However, its taking a different approach to growing it than Amazon and Walmart have, with a larger emphasis on major brand names than on small third-party resellers. Rather than opening the doors to any seller, were focused on building relevance and trust by working with partners that complement our assortment and also help us provide more of the breadth consumers are looking for, said Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez. That includes bringing in household names like Peloton, Daily Harvest and Honest Baby Clothing to the platform. To be clear, we still believe our intentional, invitation only approach is the right strategy, both now and in the long haul for Target, said chief guest experience officer Cara Sylvester, referencing Targets strategy for bringing vendors onto the marketplace. But that hasnt prevented us from massive growth. Target Plus now generates over 1 billion in gross merchandise value, having grown more than 35 in the past year alone. Beyond marketplace, Target is also going to work to double the size of its in-house media company Roundel by 2030. The company said that unit drove more than 2 billion in value last year.

"Aviation industry pushes Congress for air traffic improvements, more hiring","Aviation industry members on Tuesday again urged lawmakers for newer air traffic control technology and more hiring of air traffic controllers as airlines continue to complain about longtime shortfalls, while air travel demand has boomed. Their testimony was delivered to a House committee hearing about a month after an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on board the two aircraft in the deadliest U.S. airline crash since 2001. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last week that the Trump administration is taking steps to increase air traffic controller staffing, raising starting salaries by 30 for staff who go through the Federal Aviation Administrations academy. Air traffic controller staffing is down about 9 from 2012, while air travel demand has hit records, according to testimony from Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Duffys comments come as President Donald Trump has tasked his billionaire advisor Elon Musk with cost-cutting throughout the federal government. But Musks involvement has raised concerns about conflicts of interest from Democratic lawmakers, especially since the FAA is one of the regulators of Musks company SpaceX. The cost cuts have included layoffs of about 300 FAA employees. The Department of Transportation said it didnt include air traffic controllers. This demoralizes the entire workforce and distracts from the agencys efforts to modernize and improve the aviation system  as well as taking away from the primary mission of the FAA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the U.S. aviation system and ultimately, the safety of the American flying public, David Spero, president of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, said in written testimony. He said, blanket changes, indiscriminate dismissals or other arbitrary edicts will not help this country maintain the safest air traffic control system. For his part, Nick Calio, head of Airlines for America, which represents major U.S. airlines including United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others, recommended relying on Musks so-called Department of Government Efficiency or procurement experts from the private sector to revise the procurement standards, policies, practices and procedures of the FAA to reduce any impediments to the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, or other sources, as required.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/aviation-industry-air-traffic-control.html,2025-03-08
Airline stocks fall as possible economic 'soft patch' raises demand concerns,"U.S. airline stocks tumbled Tuesday to their lowest levels since late last year after data showed some economic concerns, hitting what had been a bright spot for consumer spending. The moves also come after President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on Mexico and Canada and raised tariffs on Chinese goods, actions that were met with plans for retaliatory duties. Some executives, including the heads of Best Buy and Target, warned the tariffs could mean higher prices for consumers. United Airlines, which has the most exposure to China of the U.S. airlines, fell about 6, along with Delta Air Lines. American Airlines dropped close to 4 for the day, while domestic-focused carriers JetBlue Airways lost nearly 6, Allegiant Air shed more than 9, and ultra-low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines ended more than 4 lower. Airlines, especially full-service carriers with big international networks, had been a bright spot thanks to strong demand and moderating domestic flight growth, but some analysts are now anticipating potential demand impacts, particularly for more price-sensitive customers ahead of the crucial spring travel season. U.S. consumer spending fell in January for the first time in almost two years, the U.S. Commerce Department said last week. Earlier in February, its retail sales report from a month earlier showed a bigger-than-expected drop. While we continue to remain constructive on the supply backdrop  which we still believe is favorable  our attention has shifted to what appears to be an emerging economic soft patch, Deutsche Bank said in a note Tuesday. To what extent and duration are not clear at the present, however, we do think it will likely weigh on demand for air travel, particularly the domestic discretionary segment. The bank said it has not seen any signs of weakness in corporate or long-haul international travel. Business is really robust, United Airlines CFO Mike Leskinen said at a Barclays industry conference last month. International leisure is very strong. Domestic leisure is kind of OK. Its fine. Its what we expected. Leskinen said that government travel, which accounts for about 2 of Uniteds revenue has fallen off after government layoffs and other cost-cutting measures since Trump took office. Delta saw softness in domestic demand last month because of slower government travel, bad weather and in the wake of the deadly American Airlines regional jet collision in January, as well as Deltas crash landing in Toronto last month, in which all survived, Raymond James said in a note on Tuesday. The carriers spring break bookings were strong, however, as was near-term international demand, particularly for U.S.-Europe trips, Raymond James said following meetings with a Deltas head of network planning and revenue.",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/airline-stocks-tumble-amid-economic-concerns.html,2025-03-08
"Trump's Mexico tariffs could raise produce prices in the next few days, Target CEO says","In this article Shoppers will likely see produce prices increase in the coming days due to President Donald Trumps tariffs on Mexican imports, Target CEO Brian Cornell said Tuesday. The Trump administrations 25 levies on goods from Mexico and Canada, along with an additional 10 duty on Chinese imports, took effect Tuesday. Cornell said Target relies heavily on Mexican produce during the winter months, and the tariffs could force the company to raise prices on fruits and vegetables as soon as this week. Those are categories where well try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days, he told CNBC in an interview after Target released its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. If theres a 25 tariff, those prices will go up, Cornell added. Cornell said prices could rise for produce like strawberries, avocados and bananas. During an investor day later that morning, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said it was too early to provide more specifics on the products and categories that will see price increases because teams are working through it in real time and the company has to look at pricing holistically. Ill give you an example. We have 3 Christmas ornaments. We dont want to have 3.60 Christmas ornaments. We want to keep them at 3. That means we have to think about margin elsewhere. So maybe well take pricing up a little bit on stockings to cover where we are in Christmas ornaments, said Gomez. Another example he cited was Targets 5 tees. The company wants to continue charging 5 flat for T-shirts. So while it may leave that price unchanged, it has more flexibility to hike prices for other products, such as dresses. So maybe well look at dresses a little bit differently, said Gomez. So its actually not as simple as just like flowing through cost. We have to think about this from a consumer perspective and make sure that our pricing architecture makes sense and puts us in a place where we are competitive and we have affordable options. While inflation has eased in recent months, price increases have not moderated as much as the Federal Reserve has hoped. High costs for food and housing have continued to stretch consumer budgets, and Trumps tariffs have raised fears that households will face even higher expenses. The president and his advisors have contended the duties will not raise prices for consumers. When asked if he had spoken to Trump directly about the impact tariffs will have on prices, Cornell told CNBC he has not had that conversation with the president and instead has relied on the retail industrys lobbying arm to speak on Targets behalf. Weve certainly been very active in Washington making sure that we provide our point of view, and we rely on the National Retail Federation and the industry to provide our perspective to a broad number of members of the administration, said Cornell. So we worked very closely with the NRF and the Retail Industry Leaders Association to make sure that collective...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/trump-mexico-tariffs-will-raise-produce-prices-target-ceo-cornell-says.html,2025-03-08
"Target warns February sales were soft, adding to concerns about consumer health","In this article Target on Tuesday warned that it expects a meaningful drop in first-quarter profit compared with the year-ago period as it contends with ongoing consumer uncertainty, soft sales in February and concerns around tariffs. The first three months of the year tend to be slow for retailers because consumers typically pull back after the holiday shopping season. But Targets tepid guidance comes after Walmart and E.l.f. Beauty raised concerns last month about a slower-than-usual start to the year. Coupling those weak forecasts with a sharper-than-expected decline in consumer spending in January and the biggest drop in consumer confidence since 2021 in February, Targets guidance is the latest warning sign about the health of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Plenty of Targets troubles have been self-inflicted in recent years, but as a big-box retailer that caters to large swaths of the population, its performance can offer insight into spending patterns ahead, especially when other companies have made similar comments. In a statement, Targets finance chief, Jim Lee, said February sales were soft and declining consumer confidence hurt discretionary sales. He also blamed uncharacteristically cold weather, saying it affected apparel sales. We expect to see a moderation in this trend as apparel sales respond to warmer weather around the country, and consumers turn to Target for upcoming seasonal moments such as the Easter holiday, said Lee. We will continue to monitor these trends and will remain appropriately cautious with our expectations for the year ahead. Target CEO Brian Cornell also told CNBC that President Donald Trumps 25 tariffs on Mexican imports set to take effect Tuesday could force the company and other grocers to raise prices on produce like bananas, strawberries and avocados in the coming days. Beyond its outlook, Target reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Streets expectations. Heres how Target did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The companys shares fell nearly 5 in morning trading Tuesday. Targets net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was 1.10 billion, or 2.41 per share, compared with 1.38 billion, or 2.98 per share, a year earlier. Sales dropped to 30.92 billion, down about 3 from 31.92 billion a year earlier. In the year-ago period, Target benefited from an extra week, which has skewed year-over-year comparisons. For its current fiscal year, Target is expecting earnings per share to be between 8.80 and 9.80, which at the midpoint is more or less in line with estimates of 9.31, according to LSEG. However, its expecting sales to grow just 1, well behind estimates of 2.6, according to LSEG. Targets first-quarter guidance will also likely surprise investors. While it declined to share specific figures, Target said its expecting to see meaningful year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of ...",Business,www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/target-tgt-q4-2024-earnings.html,2025-03-08
Starbucks poaches Nordstrom CFO as executive shake-up continues,"In this article Starbucks announced Tuesday that Nordstrom Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith will join the company as its new CFO, replacing longtime veteran Rachel Ruggeri. The executive change is the latest for Starbucks after Brian Niccol joined the company as chief executive in September with the goal of turning around slumping coffee sales. So far, noteworthy departures during Niccols tenure have included the companys North American CEO, North American president, chief supply officer and the former chair of the board. Meanwhile, many executives with ties to Niccol from his time leading Chipotle Mexican Grill and Yum Brands Taco Bell have joined the company. Smith, 61, joins Starbucks after two years at Nordstrom, which is also based in Seattle and recently announced a 6.25 billion deal to go private. Throughout her decades-long career, Smith has also served as CFO for Bright Health Group, Target, Express Scripts, Walmart International, GameStop, Centex, Kennametal, Textron and Raytheon. Smith is expected to start next month, Niccol wrote in a letter to employees. Ruggeri has served as CFO for Starbucks since 2021. Excluding two brief stints at other companies, she has worked at the coffee chain since 2001. Im personally grateful for the partnership weve had over the last 6 months since I joined Starbucks, Niccol said in the letter. Thank you, Rachel, for all you have done for our business, our culture and our partners. Her departure is without cause, the company said in a regulatory filing. Ruggeri will stick around to help with Smiths transition into the role, according to Niccol. Correction: Smith is expected to start in the next month.

Best Buy shares plunge as CEO warns price increases are 'highly likely' due to Trump tariffs,"In this article Best Buy on Tuesday posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations, but CEO Corie Barry projected that prices for U.S. consumers would rise as President Donald Trumps tariffs on China and Mexico go into effect. On Best Buys earnings call, Barry said China and Mexico are the companys top two supply chain sources, with about 55 and 20 of its products sourced from those countries, respectively. Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex, Barry said. We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely. Barrys comments came as consumers and investors try to parse out how the new duties will affect household budgets, company sales and the U.S. economy. She spoke shortly after Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC that he expects consumers will see higher produce prices in a matter of days due to the Mexico tariffs. Barry added that the company directly imports only 2 to 3 of its products, and that Best Buy is reviewing and adjusting its supply chain sourcing. She said that the company typically carries six weeks of supply at a time, and that she expects pricing changes to affect the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year. The giant wild card here, obviously, is how the consumers are going to react to the price increases, in light of a lot of price increases potentially throughout the year and a general consumer confidence that is showing a little signs of weakness at the moment, Best Buy CFO Matt Bilunas said on the call. Shares of the company fell more than 13 on Tuesday morning. Heres how the consumer electronics company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the companys fiscal 2025 fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Fourth-quarter revenue fell 4.8 from 14.65 billion during the same period a year ago. Best Buy reported fourth-quarter net income of 117 million, or 54 cents per share, compared with a net income of 460 million, or 2.12 per share, during the year-ago period. Adjusting for a noncash goodwill impairment charge related to Best Buy Health and other restructuring initiatives, Best Buy reported fourth-quarter earnings of 2.58 per share. Comparable sales, defined by Best Buy as revenue from online sales and stores open at least 14 months, rose 0.5 year over year for the quarter, excluding the additional week in fiscal 2024. Best Buy had forecast a change ranging from flat to down 3. In the U.S., quarterly comparable sales rose 0.2 year over year. Full-year fiscal 2025 revenue came in at 41.53 billion, down 4.4 from 43.45 billion in fiscal 2024. Best Buys fiscal 2025 had one fewer week than the prior-year period, which the retailer estimates added 735 million in revenue to its fiscal 2024 total.

Can an LED face mask really transform your skin?,"LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting. But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from 40 to 1,500. The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly. Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny? The LED market is set to be worth 600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point. According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM). This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin, he tells the BBC. PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin, he adds. A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works. US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration. Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists for many years, according to Dr Kentley. But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices. The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skins surface when being used. Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks sound promising, mask wholesale manufacturers are speculating about their benefits. I dont believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital, she tells the BBC. No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident. So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest, she adds. Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year. This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends. Dr Kluk says she has noticed that peoples interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid and believes the visually interesti...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c334jg7lvz0o,2025-03-08
UK authorities on lookout for Lassa fever cases,"UK officials are checking for any possible cases of Lassa fever after a traveller to England, who has since returned to Nigeria, is known to have been infected. The virus does not spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the public is very low, experts advise. Anyone yet to be contacted by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is very unlikely to have had any exposure, they say. In some West African countries, where the disease is endemic, people usually become infected through exposure to food, or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of rats. Lassa fever is rare in the UK, but there have been a small number of cases before - most recently in 2022. UK officials say they are well-equipped to identify people who have Lassa fever to limit any spread of infections. The UKHSA says it is working at speed to find anyone who may have had contact with the person who had Lassa fever. Dr Meera Chand, deputy director at the UK Health Security Agency, said: Our health protection teams are working at pace to get in touch with people who were in contact with this individual while they were in England, to ensure they seek appropriate medical care and testing should they develop any symptoms. The infection does not spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the UK population is very low. People who are found to have Lassa fever will receive supportive treatment, meaning that they will be provided with fluids, monitored for their symptoms, and treated with medications depending on which symptoms they have. There is not currently an effective single treatment for the disease. Source: UKHSA",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vwzk2y52no,2025-03-08
'Nasal tanners left me suffocating in hospital',"A woman has told how she was left in hospital unable to breathe after suffering a severe reaction to an unlicensed nasal tanning spray she bought online. Edith Eagle said she felt like she was suffocating and drowning inside her own body after the allergic collapse she believes was linked to the product. Nasal tanners are designed to be sprayed into the nostrils and claim to work by administering a substance known as Melanotan II, a chemical that darkens skin pigmentation. It is illegal to sell medicinal products containing Melanotan II in the UK but as the tanners are sold cosmetically they fall outside that remit. However, they are not covered by UK cosmetics regulations, meaning they are not subjected to the same scrutiny as other over-the-counter beauty products. Experts have said they have not been fully researched and could contain toxic ingredients. Ms Eagle said she purchased tanners online believing they would give her a quick and easy bronzed look ahead of a planned holiday to Fuerteventura in April 2023. They had been recommended to her by someone she knew, but she said she did not realise they were unlicensed and unregulated. The 47-year-old, from Kings Lynn in Norfolk, inhaled the spray twice a day, believing it would give her tan time to build up before we actually get into the sunshine. But on the second day of the trip she was rushed to hospital after the apparent allergic reaction spiralled. I literally could not breathe, she said. And all what went through my mind was, will I even get to the hospital because I could not breathe. I cant even explain it, but I was suffocating inside. It was as if I was drowning within my own body. Ms Eagle said she became suspicious after her stepdaughter, who also used a tanner, spotted a Facebook post from someone who said they had also suffered a bad reaction. She told her hospital consultant, who asked where she had bought the tanner and what was in it. He also became suspicious, she said. Of course, there was nothing on it apart from a pretty label on the front, no ingredients whatsoever. There was nothing, really, I could show him. And that was a frightening thing, she said. Once I was allowed to go back to the hotel the consultant said Just remember next time, you may not be so lucky. The products are promoted on social media and are readily available to buy online, while the BBC has also found beauty salons and tanning shops advertising them for sale. The BBC North West and North East Investigations team visited high street premises to see how easy they were to obtain. In Manchester and on Merseyside, a reporter managed to purchase several sprays from salons for between 20 and 25, sold with minimal instructions and no acknowledgment of any risks or dangers. In Newcastle, a staff member at a gym sold a reporter an extreme strength spray for 25, with verbal instructions to use it before taking a sun bed. Also on Merseyside, the BBC was able to buy a quadruple strength spray on offer for 20, ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4p4v8y8eo,2025-03-08
More schools to be asked to supervise toothbrushing,"School and nursery staff in the most deprived areas of England will be asked to supervise young children while they brush their teeth, under a national toothbrushing programme. Schemes are already running in some schools - but now dedicated central funding will reach the poorest areas where children are most at risk of tooth decay, the government says. Dental experts said the move would save children from pain and the NHS a fortune. But the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) union said caution was needed to avoid shifting what is ultimately a parental responsibility on to the burden on schools. National supervised toothbrushing programmes have been running in Scotland since 2006 and Wales since 2009. And in Northern Ireland, some nursery staff have been supervising toothbrushing since 2016, in a funded programme targeting the poorest 20 of areas. Teachers and other staff demonstrate and help, without directly brushing the childrens teeth, at some point during the school day. The idea, according to experts, is not to replace toothbrushing at home but to help build skills, good habits and confidence. But in England, provision is patchy, partly because of logistical problems but also a lack of staff and dedicated funding. About one out of every four five-year-olds in England has had tooth decay - and in poorer areas, it is one in three. Tooth decay is the most common reason five-to-nine-year-olds in England are admitted to hospital. And in many areas, access to an NHS dentist has become increasingly difficult. Abbies daughter goes to a nursery in Bridlington where toothbrushing lessons already take place. She says her toddler was quite toothbrush shy but the scheme has helped. When we first started toothbrushing she refused to do it at home  it was a two person job. I think in nursery it is different, it is quite an event. They all do it together - it is quite social, they sing a song, she told the BBC. Bridlington only has one NHS dentist practice accepting patients. Her children and husband have had to register in a different town. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said focusing on prevention would help give children the best start in life. It is shocking that a third of five-year-olds in the most deprived areas have experience of tooth decay - something we know can have a lifelong impact on their health, he said. Its why were delivering supervised toothbrushing to young children and families who are most in need of support, as part of our wider plans to revive the oral health of the nation. The government says it is also working to reform the dental contract, so dentists take on more NHS work. From April, local authorities will be given 11m funding and asked to identify schools and nurseries most in need. The aim is to reach about 600,000 three-to-five-year-olds a year. For every 1 spent on the scheme, 3 in treatment costs will be avoided  adding up to more than 34m over the next five years, the government says.

Victim records claims sickening - attacks families,"The families of the Nottingham attack victims have said claims healthcare staff illegally accessed medical records belonging to their loved ones are sickening and inexcusable. Barnaby Webber and Grace OMalley-Kumar, both 19, and Ian Coates, 65, were stabbed to death by Valdo Calocane in the city in June 2023. Dr Manjeet Shehmar, medical director at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said the trust was investigating concerns that members of staff may have inappropriately accessed the medical records of the three victims. The families described the news as distressing and traumatic in a joint statement. The families of Ian, Grace, and Barnaby have already had to endure much pain and heartache and Im truly sorry that this will add further to their suffering, Dr Shehmar said. Through our investigation, we will find out what happened and will not hesitate to take action as necessary. The claims of the medical records being accessed inappropriately were first reported by the Daily Mirror. In a joint statement, the families of Mr Coates, Ms OMalley-Kumar and Mr Webber said: We cannot begin to describe how distressing and traumatic it is for us to learn of yet more revelations regarding the actions of individuals in the horror of losing our loved ones. These are not just data breaches for us, they are gross invasions of privacy and civil liberty. For people to choose to access information regarding the vicious attack and murder of Barney, Grace and Ian with no reason to do so is sickening. Its gross and inexcusable voyeurism at the most repugnant level. We know that whilst some staff across the multiple agencies would need to access records, images and data, dozens, perhaps even hundreds, didnt. God only knows what may have been looked at, discussed and shared. It comes a few months after an investigation was opened into allegations Ministry of Justice (MoJ) staff illegally accessed computer files related to the Nottingham attacks. A special constable with Nottinghamshire Police was previously sacked for viewing bodycam footage showing the aftermath of the attacks. In the June 2023 attack, Calocane killed Mr Webber, Ms OMalley-Kumar and Mr Coates, before using Mr Coatess van to drive into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - in the city centre. Calocane was sentenced to a hospital order in January 2024 after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Following Calocanes sentencing, the families were highly critical of the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). A subsequent review into the CPS found that while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocanes pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better. There have been a number of other reviews, including an investigation into the NHS mental healthcare and treatment he received prior to the killings, published in early February.

Scientists discover new part of the immune system,"A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said. Theyve shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals. The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection. And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs. The discovery centres on the proteasome  a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body. Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones. But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria. It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them. Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening. We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection. Its happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics. The research team went through a process they called dumpster diving to find these natural antibiotics. They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics. And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella. Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were extremely provocative and very interesting as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection. Whats really exciting about this, is its a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising. But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that still needs to be tested and that will take time. More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics. But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand. Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists. Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at Kings College London, told the BBC: Its a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, thats quite exciting. In previous years its been digging up soil to find new antibiotics, it is wild that its something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.

Common vaginal 'imbalance' may be an STI,"A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers. The NHS currently says BV is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI, even though it can be triggered by sex. However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI. The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection. BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell. The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery. Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though. Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching. It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams. In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics. The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach. One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI. Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still dont know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery, she added. In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment. Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected  that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections. This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases, said a spokesperson. If you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lj7e0519xo,2025-03-08
The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want,"The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but thats not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s. Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer. His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone. Apart from medication from Terrys GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, there was nothing, says Gillian. I couldnt understand why  we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didnt know what to do and was doing my best to care for him. He was in agony at times  crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless. As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him, says Gillian. He died just over two weeks later. He was 67. It was not how he wanted to spend his last days, she tells me today. I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did. Terry and Gillians story is far from unique  and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives. Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms. Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel coerced by a lack of better alternatives. Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home, Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital. It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any. And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months. But this hasnt always been the case - until recently the picture was very different. As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Boots recalls paracetamol over labelling error,"The High Street pharmacy chain Boots is asking customers to return packs of 500-milligram paracetamol tablets because a labelling error incorrectly states they are a different painkiller, aspirin. More than 110,000 packs, with the batch number 241005 and expiry date 122029 on the bottom, are affected. Customers can receive a full refund without a receipt. Boots and the supplier, Aspar Pharmaceuticals Limited, have begun a full investigation. The outer cardboard packaging is correctly labelled: Paracetamol 500mg Tablets but the inner foil blister pack of pills instead reads: Aspirin 300mg Dispersable Tablets. The affected packs should not be used or kept, even if the error is known, as this could lead to an incorrect dose. And anyone who has bought this product for someone else should tell them as soon as possible. Dr Stephanie Millican, from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said: Patient safety is always our priority. It is vitally important that you check the packaging of your Boots Paracetamol 500mg Tablets 16s - and if the batch number is 241005, you should stop using the product and return it to a Boots store for a full refund. If you are unsure which pack you have purchased or have taken Boots Paracetamol 500mg Tablets and experienced any side effects, seek advice from a healthcare professional. Please report any suspected adverse reactions via the MHRAs Yellow Card scheme.

Warning over rapid at-home prostate tests,"At-home tests for men worried about prostate cancer can give inconsistent and inaccurate results, BBC News has found. The tests, which resemble a Covid lateral flow strip, turn positive if a high level of a protein called PSA is detected in a drop of blood. Of five rapid tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative or all-clear, but one returned a false positive result - all from the same blood sample. Prostate Cancer UK said it had significant concerns about the sale of the tests given their questionable accuracy and the absence of a doctor to interpret the results. There is no national prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. Instead, the onus is on men to request a blood test from their GP once they are over 50 years old, or from 45 for higher risk groups. That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen. A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease. PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer. Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024. Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels. They are available online and from some pharmacies and convenience stores with prices from 6 to 95. They come in two main types: The BBC analysed five rapid tests all bought online from different companies, using a blood sample taken on the same day. The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer and must not claim to detect cancer. Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to screen for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules. Others are sold to monitor prostate health or identify potential prostate issues early. One of the home tests ordered by the BBC also arrived in packaging and with instructions clearly marked for professional use only. For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use. A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette. Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ugl. A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ugl. As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy, says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl00gn15y8o,2025-03-08
Autistic woman wrongly locked up in mental health hospital for 45 years,"An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned. The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years. Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her. The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention. More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness. The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol. But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10 reduction. However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we havent seen the progress that was promised, he told us. Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibbas incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her. I hadnt ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised, Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day. Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibbas identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held. It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a childrens home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital. Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as dangerous and an eye-gouger. She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to t...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly43png991o,2025-03-08
Over 50% of adults worldwide predicted to be obese or overweight by 2050,"More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050. The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries. Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries. However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a profound tragedy. By 2021, almost half the global adult population - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese. The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990. If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4 for men and 60.3 for women by 2050. In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050. However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250 to 522 million. Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese. The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future. Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems. The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US. She said: Governments can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies. The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure, she added. A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people. Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8 to 18.1) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9 to 20.3) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021. However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected. The co-lead author of the report, Dr Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Australia, says the figures present a real challenge to health care systems in the coming years. But if we act now, preventing a complete transition t...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87d2g81yxo,2025-03-08
'He was born navy blue': Real-life stories behind Toxic Town Netflix series,"Netflixs new drama Toxic Town revisits one of the UKs biggest environmental scandals: the Corby toxic waste case. The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution. Corbys steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks. By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination. In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste. Families affected won an undisclosed financial settlement in 2010, held in trust until the children turned 18. Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents. Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted. Here are some of the key voices behind the story. George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby. Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift. Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers Georges birth, an event that would change their lives forever. Born navy blue as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care. It was then Fiona noticed something unusual. I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger, she says. It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out. I just kept thinking, Hes here because of me, and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself. At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in Georges hand so large that amputation became a real possibility. The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. When I woke up, I was so full of morphine, he remembers. They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice  my body just shut down. The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. They burn flesh as they operate: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And thats the smell that still comes to you from time to time. Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. The first time I saw my hand, I wasnt shocked. I wasnt sad. It was better than before. But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions. Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything. On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to h...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pzl605kzo,2025-03-08
Cancer family 'financially broken' by benefits wait,"Families of children and young people with cancer are struggling financially for several months waiting for benefits to help cover extra costs caused by the illness, according to a charity. Young Lives vs Cancer says families need immediate help with additional living costs, which amount to 700 a month on average - and is calling for quicker access to the funds. One family has said they were left financially broken by the extra living costs after their 16-year-old son Olivers leg had to be amputated because he had a rare type of cancer. The government says it is committed to giving people access to benefits in a timely manner, but acknowledges that waits are too high. Kerry Bolton, from Solihull, said she had to wait five months before a decision was made on her benefits application after her son Oliver was diagnosed with cancer, aged 16. The hospital is an hour away from us and I dont drive. It was costing us 48 a day for us to travel in taxis there and back. Oliver later underwent a leg amputation, meaning his family had to buy new clothes to fit him. They also faced higher electricity bills to charge his prosthetic leg, Ms Bolton said. Ollies leg needs electricity...if I dont have electricity, he cant walk. Ms Bolton said she also had to use more energy to heat her home to keep Oliver warm, because of his immunosuppression treatment. During a childs cancer treatment, families may need to travel to distant appointments, buy special food, use more electricity and heating, pay for childcare for siblings, and stay in hotels. Under UK law, cancer patients may be entitled to benefits to help with costs. However, patients are not eligible for financial support until they have been ill for three months. They then face a further wait of four months on average for their application to be assessed, according to Young Lives vs Cancer, which has interviewed hundreds of patients and put out a new report. The charity is calling for families to qualify for benefits immediately following a diagnosis. Danielle Roberts, from North Wales, told the BBC that she experienced financial strain as soon as her nine-year-old daughter Jasmine was diagnosed with cancer last year, but she did not receive any benefits for eight months. We were just thrown into this world where...our childs got cancer and we dont know if shes going to survive, along with dealing with the financial impact. Youve still got all these bills to pay on top of going back and forward to hospital, which was an hour and 15 minutes away, extra food, accommodation. Ms Roberts said having to take long periods off work added to the financial strain. My income was dramatically reduced because its hard to work when your child is in hospital... and you dont want to work, you should be able to spend time with your child when theyre poorly. What were seeing is heartbreaking, Young People vs Cancers chief executive Rachel Kirby-Rider told the BBC.

UK death rate 'reaches record low',"The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News. Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019. However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement. The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, its pretty poor by historical standards, said Stuart McDonald from the CMI. There was also a concerning rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said. A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was shifting focus from sickness to prevention. The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances. From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths. To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK. Clearly, its very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was, says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The Kings Fund. But if you look at the broader canvas then its not so good. Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UKs has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the bottom of the pack of comparable countries, she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the low hanging fruit of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder. At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS. Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say its not possible to prove this directly. Dementia and Alzheimers disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK, said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation. The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j09vn2x2ko,2025-03-08
GPs strike deal to help end '8am scramble' for appointments,"Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with Englands GPs, the government has said. The deal gives an extra 889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients. The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back family doctors and end the early morning phone scramble for appointments. The doctors union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices. However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament. GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under. Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments. Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar 8am scramble for a same-day appointment. Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am. It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up. Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised. The new contract says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need. The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2. The total figure includes almost 800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients. Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff. GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations. Through cutting what the government describes as box-ticking targets, ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the 8am scramble for an appointment. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as a broken NHS. Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared, he said. Thats why patients are struggling to get an appointment. This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs time and backing them with an extra 889m next year. In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment. Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs committee, says this contract is...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7ee895nr0o,2025-03-08
Cancer patients 'may starve' without vital drug,"Cancer patients and others with debilitating conditions have highlighted shortages of a vital drug they say have had a devastating impact on their lives. Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert), helps digestion, but has been hard to obtain for the last year and shortages are predicted to last until 2026. It is thought more than 61,000 patients in the UK need it, including those with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. Some patients said through Your Voice, Your BBC News that they have had to cover long distances to find a pharmacist with supplies. The Department of Health and Social care says it is working closely with the NHS, manufacturers and others in the supply chain to try to resolve the issues. Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which means their ability to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy is reduced. Diana Gibb, who is 74, and her husband Mick, 78, live in Tonbridge, Kent. Mick had a major operation to treat pancreatic cancer in 2023. Diana wrote to BBC News explaining that it is impossible for Mick to digest food without creon. She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine. We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week. Pharmacies cannot get hold of lower dosage either and there is no alternative medication. I was worried that my husband would starve to death without them. Diana says for now they can get supplies of the drug but there is no guarantee week-to-week, and that is still a big worry. Bryony Thomas, who is from Stroud in Gloucestershire, needs creon after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly. She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe. At one stage, she says she obtained the drug from another patient, who had a surplus, against regulations via Instagram. She describes her situation as constantly stressful. Leading pancreatic clinicians and charities including Pancreatic Cancer UK have written to the prime minister saying the absence of Pert can have a devastating impact on peoples lives, with doctors and pharmacists inundated with requests for help from desparate patients. The letter says that without the drug, people experience horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life. There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical ex...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry84d5jq5o,2025-03-08
Physician associate role is 'misleading' - coroner,"A coroner has said the public is being misled over what an NHS physician associate (PA) does after a woman died following hospital failings, including being misdiagnosed with a nosebleed. Pamela Marking went to AE at East Surrey Hospital in February 2024 after vomiting blood and having tenderness in her side. She was told by a PA she had a nosebleed and was sent home, but the 77-year-old actually had a hernia and died four days later following complications with her care after being readmitted to hospital. A Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust spokesperson said it would look carefully at the coroners report to learn lessons on improving services and delivering the safest possible care. Our deepest sympathies remain with Ms Markings family and loved ones at this very difficult time, they added. We wish to express our profound regret for their loss. An NHS spokesperson said the NHS has always been clear that physician associates are not replacements for doctors and should only practice with appropriate medical supervision. But there remain legitimate concerns about the roles, they added. The coroners prevention of future deaths report, sent to the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England, said the PA did not understand the significance of Ms Markings symptoms and had not examined her fully. Dr Karen Henderson, assistant coroner for Surrey, called the term physician associate misleading and said there was a lack of public knowledge that they were not medically qualified. PAs are graduates - usually with a health or life sciences degree - who have undertaken two years of postgraduate training. The NHS said they work under the supervision of a doctor and can diagnose people, take medical histories, perform physical examinations, see patients with long-term conditions, analyse test results and develop management plans. This blurring of roles without public knowledge... has the potential to devalue and undermine public confidence in the medical profession, said Dr Henderson. She added it could also compromise patient safety with PAs potentially undertaking roles outside their competency. The Department of Health and Social Care said it had launched an independent review into physician associates to establish the facts and make sure that we get the right people in the right places providing the right care.

Health chiefs warn of potential second norovirus wave,"People who have already had norovirus, the winter vomiting bug, could be at risk of catching it again this season, experts from the the UKs Health Security Agency say. Data shows a different strain of the virus is on the rise and having had one strain doesnt necessarily protect you from catching another, they advise. Norovirus can be particularly severe for young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Cases are currently still exceptionally high with numbers at more than double the five-season-average for this time of year, latest figure show. Amy Douglas, Lead Epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said the biggest impact was being seen in hospitals and care homes. With multiple genotypes spreading at the same time, people could end up getting infected more than once this season, she added. Cases have been higher than expected partly because of the emergence of a recent strain of the virus called GII.17, but also because of improved ways of testing for the virus. Data now shows that a different, but more commonly seen strain, is on the rise. This means people who have already had the bug could catch it again as having one version of the virus does not fully protect you against the other. There is no suggestion that either strain leads to more severe illness than expected, however. Norovirus cases usually starts to decline as the weather warms up, but the UKHSA says it is too soon to work out whether cases have peaked. The total remains close to its record high, with an average of 1,134 patients a day in hospital with norovirus last week  down slightly on the previous week (1,160), but still nearly two and a half times that seen in the same period last year. Symptoms of norovirus include: If you think you may have norovirus, experts advise: Many household disinfectants do not work well against the virus. Nor do alcohol hand gels. If you are concerned - for example if a young child is not able to keep fluids down or the illness does not stop after a few days - make sure you seek medical advice Do not visit hospitals and care homes or prepare food for others, until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlyy2e5w4vo,2025-03-08
Michelle Mone-linked PPE firm evidence to be heard in private,"The chair of the Covid inquiry has ruled that evidence related to PPE Medpro, the firm linked to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, will be heard in a closed, private session next month. On 3 March, the inquiry will begin four weeks of hearings into decisions to buy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Baroness Hallett said she was imposing the restriction as she was satisfied there was a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings if sensitive evidence was heard in public. Victims groups and media outlets, including the BBC, had argued the dangers were overstated, given the early stage of the police investigation and the material already in the public domain. The National Crime Agency (NCA) opened an investigation into PPE Medpro in May 2021 into suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement of PPE. The company was awarded government contracts worth more than 200m after Baroness Mone recommended the firm to ministers during the Covid pandemic. Baroness Mone, 52, and Mr Barrowman, 59, have denied wrongdoing. In June 2024, the NCA said an unnamed 46-year-old man from Barnet, north London, had been arrested as part of its investigation. To date, no criminal charges have been brought and the Crown Prosecution Service has not been formally instructed by the NCA. On 9 December 2024, the Covid inquiry said it had received an application from the NCA for a restriction order, claiming there was a risk of harm to its investigation if sensitive evidence about PPE Medpro was heard in public. The NCA originally wanted to prevent the inquiry hearing any evidence about the company, saying other contracts could be selected. It then asked for 26 witness statements written by its staff to be withheld, and an order to be made preventing certain questions about the firm to be asked in the inquiry room in a public session. It argued those restrictions should include the identity of any person under investigation; evidence relating to the opinion of any government official concerning PPE Medpros contracts; and evidence about payments to the company and who ultimately benefited. In its submission, it said there was a realistic possibility that criminal charges against one or more individuals will flow from the investigation. The Department of Health later asked for the terms of any restriction order to be widened to include any financial material and correspondence relating to the purchase of PPE from the company, although that request has been rejected by the inquiry. In her final ruling, Baroness Hallett said it was both necessary and proportionate for the Covid inquiry to examine contracts between the government and PPE Medpro. But she did accept there was a risk of damage to any future criminal proceedings if she allowed all the evidence to be heard in public. As a result, any sensitive evidence about the company will be heard in a private, closed hearing, expected to be held in late March. She said the NCAs origina...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rkj8pv684o,2025-03-08
'I discovered my fat build-up condition after a Love Islander had it',"For years, Emma Griffiths was self-conscious about the fact her legs had grown out of proportion with the rest of her body. But it wasnt until she was watching Love Island one night that the nurse noticed contestant Shaughna Phillips had the same shape legs - and started doing some research. Experts online suggested Shaughna had lipoedema and amateur triathlete Emma then knew this is what I had, Im not just obese. The 35-year-old mother has now joined calls for more support to be available on the NHS for people with lipoedema. Lipoedema causes fat to abnormally build-up mainly in the hips, buttocks and legs, leading to a disproportionate shape. The exact cause of the chronic condition is unknown but it is not from being overweight. Lipoedema may be caused by changes in hormones and is believed to affect about one in 10 people worldwide - although many do not know they have it. Emma was about 11 when her legs started to feel heavy and throb and said they started to grow bigger. I was looking in the mirror and thinking theres something wrong here, why are my legs different to girls my age?, she recalled. Despite leading a healthy lifestyle and at one point losing five stone, Emmas bottom half remained bigger and she suspected something was wrong. I thought this is not responding to diet and exercise - something is going on here, said the mum-of-two from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire. If I hadnt had seen Shaughna Phillips on Love Island, I dont think I would have known that I had lipoedema... or at that point, had the diagnosis. I went to see the GP and he didnt know what I was talking about. Despite having some NHS support, Emma asked to be referred to a lymphoedema clinic and a private surgeon diagnosed her with stage two lipoedema in 2022. Liposuction surgery removed four litres of fat from her thighs and while Emma said it helped, she said it did not cure her condition. She now manages it through a healthy lifestyle, wearing compression stockings and dry brushing her skin. She says that helps with swelling and pain relief. Gemma Robinson has also struggled with lipoedema and before her surgery, her legs were estimated to weigh about 11 stone (70kg). The 45-year-old has spent almost 70k on eight surgeries over two years to have 86 litres of fat and excess skin removed. Every time I was going back to the clinic my legs were growing, said the mother-of-two from Cardiff. Gemma said at one point she was almost housebound and could only get around through the help of a pushchair or shopping trolley. Despite losing nine and a half stone, she said it was mainly from her top half. My mobility was decreasing and I was going to end up in a wheelchair with my children pushing me, she said. Gemma spent years going back and forth to her GP where she claims her symptoms were brushed off and put down to obesity, until she saw something on TV and asked for a referral.

Blumenthal: 'I thought the TV was talking to me',"TV chef and restaurateur Heston Blumenthal said being sectioned was the best thing to have happened as he opened up about his bipolar symptoms. The 58-year-old, who was diagnosed with the condition in 2023 after being admitted to hospital, told BBC Breakfast how he once hallucinated a gun on the table. This wasnt all the time, but it was getting greater and greater, and being sectioned was the best thing that could happen to me, he said. Blumenthal, who runs several award-winning restaurants, including the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, has now become an official ambassador for Bipolar UK. According to the charity, the mental health condition is an episodic disorder characterised by sometimes extreme changes in mood and energy which has the highest risk of suicide of any mental health condition. I laughed out loud after receiving a message from a woman who told me that during a manic episode she thought the TV was talking to her, Blumenthal, who also has ADHD, said. The reason I laughed out loud was because I experienced the same thing. The chef said it was really difficult for his wife, French businesswoman Melanie Ceysson, who he married in 2023. She had to decide how I would take it being sectioned and ... my response was, I embraced it, but I never thought I was going to be diagnosed as being bipolar, I thought at the time, the highs and the lows were normal, but they werent. And they werent right for me, and they werent right for the people around me that ... cared for me. The NHS says a person can be detained, also known as sectioning, under the Mental Health Act and can be treated without their agreement if they need urgent treatment for a mental health disorder and are at risk of harm to themselves or others. Famous for his experimental dishes such as snail porridge and bacon and egg ice cream, Blumenthal said medication initially dulled his culinary imagination. I was zombified - I had no energy at all. As my medications have been changed and my levels of self-confidence and self-awareness have gone up I realise my imagination and creativity is still there, he said. It was at levels that were so extreme before... looking back I can remember during my manic highs I was interrupting myself with ideas. He said someone recently asked him if there was a button I could press to turn off my bipolar - would I press it?, to which he replied, no, I wouldnt, because its part of me. He has since returned to the kitchen and said he was thinking more clearly. Bipolar UK estimates more than one million adults in the UK have the disorder, about 30 more than the number of people with dementia. But it is estimated at least 500,000 people are undiagnosed. Its an honour to have Heston onboard as an ambassador, Simon Kitchen, chief executive of Bipolar UK, said. We hope that his experience will encourage more people to seek help if they are struggling with their own diagnosis or are in the process of seeking one.

Are noise-cancelling headphones to blame for young people's hearing problems?,"Whether its the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local café, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day. But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts. This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesnt listen, zones out, or is a bit ditsy. Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I cant listen to where the noise is coming from. I know its the persons voice, I just cant really compute it quick enough, she said. After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words. Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasnt until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from. She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear, she said. It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the overwhelming noise. The cause of Sophies APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play. Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use. Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling. APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing. Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on. Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering. Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particular...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkjvr7x5x6o,2025-03-08
Clive Myrie: What I saw during my 24 hours at a London hospital,"Its just before 10:00 GMT at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. Raymond Dubbery is 81 and suffering from pneumonia. His hair thinning, hes frail and very thin. The skin hangs from his limbs. Transferred here from his care home, hes not eating much. The hope is he could be discharged soon, but he doesnt like his care home and doesnt want to go back. Dr Khai Lee Cheah, consultant in elderly care, holds his hand. Raymond tells her he wants to live somewhere hell be happy. I take your point completely, she tells Raymond. That your care home should be somewhere to live, and not just somewhere to die. Im spending 24 hours at the Royal Free for a glimpse of the challenges facing the NHS as it grapples with intense winter pressures. For patients like Raymond, who has no family, hospital staff have become social workers - a point of human contact at a time when the social care sector is under strain. Its a dilemma for the medical staff, with 15-30 of patients at the Royal Free medically fit to be discharged but unable to go home, for a myriad of reasons. The hospital has its own discharge team - whose job it is to safely get patients out of the door, to free up beds for new admissions. Just under 14,000 people who are medically fit are still in English hospitals and cant go home, through no fault of their own. At the Royal Free London Trust, there are 275 people occupying beds who dont need to, at three major sites. That makes up nearly 20 of all the beds the trust has. Faye Rogers, on the discharge team, has been on the phone with a removals company. Shes trying to get someone to visit the home of a patient to shift a wardrobe in the bedroom, to make space for an essential hospital bed. This is the kind of issue we have to deal with every day, she says. Sometimes a family member has the keys to a patients house, and theyve gone on holiday. Some patients forget the key code to their front door, so no one can get in. The problems are mundane and routine but make it difficult for people to be discharged and theyre a regular occurrence. Mid-afternoon is easily the quietest time during our 24 hours at the Royal Free, with some of the ambulance staff we come across cautioning that things will change as day turns to night. And they are right. From around 8pm, more and more patients turn up at AE, on foot and by ambulance. All the assessment bays where patients are triaged on arrival fill up quickly and are in constant use for the next five hours. That leads to a spillover into the corridors, with patients in wheelchairs, on hospital beds and gurneys filling all the available space. The wards on either side are full too. Its cramped and depressing - but a familiar scene in hospitals right across England. At around 10pm we come across Cathleen Hill whos 86, sitting in a wheelchair among those in the corridor. She has a facial injury and a bloody nose. She tells me she arrived at the hospital seven hours earlier. She has already seen a doctor but is now havi...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93lzygn3j1o,2025-03-08
"UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show","Boys born in the UK in 2023 can expect to live on average to the age of 86.7, and girls to 90, latest data suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says figures show a continued trend of longer life expectancy for men and women. The survival gap between the sexes is narrowing, partly down to men leading healthier lifestyles, experts say. Projections suggest more than one in 10 boys and one in six girls born in 2023 will live to at least 100 years old. The ONS report is based on the most up-to-date survival figures for 2023, and makes predictions for the future based on trends and projections. For example, one in four baby girls and nearly one in five baby boys born in 2047 might expect to live to 100. Overall, men born in 2047 could have a life expectancy of 89.3 years, and women 92.2 years. The estimates could change though, and the life expectancy figures are for populations - they do not mean that each individual person will live into old age. Men aged 65 years in the UK in 2023 can expect to live, on average, a further 19.8 years. For women who were 65 in 2023, the figure is 22.5 more years of life. Projections suggest that by 2047, this could to rise to 21.8 more years of life for 65-year-old men and 24.4 more years for mid-60s women. Kerry Gadsdon from the ONS said the statistics show that the life expectancy gap between men and women is closing, and has been for decades. This is likely due to improvements in lifestyle, for example reduction in smoking rates and the working conditions of men over several decades, as well as advances in healthcare, for example the prevention and treatment of heart disease. The gap is projected to be down to 2.5 years by 2072.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgl6z423jeo,2025-03-08
Surgeon suspended after children hurt by treatment,"A specialist surgeon has been suspended from a world-renowned NHS hospital after children under their care were left with lasting injuries. A review was commissioned at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, after concerns were raised by the surgeons colleagues in October. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said an independent expert found operations involving nine children fell below expected standards on several occasions over the past two and a half years. The trusts chief executive Roland Sinker said: We are very sorry that this has happened and we apologise unreservedly to our patients and their families. Addenbrookes is the East of Englands designated major trauma centre. The review, completed in January, analysed a number of complex paediatric hip surgery cases performed at the hospital. It found some of the childrens quality of life had been affected, including their mobility. The procedures in question did not result in amputation, but some of the children required further surgery they otherwise would not have needed, the trust said. The doctor was put on restricted duties while the investigation took place. They were suspended after the review and were fully co-operating with the trusts process, Mr Sinker said. A helpline was made available for parents who were concerned about the treatment their children had received. The trust has also been contacting the patients and their families to schedule appointments and undergo further clinical assessments where required. Mr Sinker said: We take this matter extremely seriously and are committed to ensuring all affected patients and families receive appropriate care and support. The hospital trust contacted the General Medical Council, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission in light of the review. We will identify whether there were any opportunities to have identified these concerns earlier as well as any wider learning and changes required in the immediate and longer term, Mr Sinker added. He said a further review was planned looking at all the operations undertaken by the surgeon during their employment at the trust. It is the second NHS hospital performing complex surgery to have reviewed the work of a paediatric surgeon in the past six months. In September, Great Ormond Street Hospital in central London reviewed the cases of about 700 children after concerns about one of its doctors.

"Fifty countries affected by USAID freeze, says WHO","Programmes to tackle HIV, polio, mpox and bird flu have been affected by the freeze on tens of billions of dollars of overseas aid from the US, says the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). US President Donald Trump has taken steps to close the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that its spending is totally unexplainable. However, WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged the Trump administration to consider resuming aid funding until other solutions can be found. HIV treatments and other services have been disrupted in 50 countries, he said at a briefing on Wednesday. Speaking publicly for the first time about the freeze on US aid funding, at a virtual press conference in Geneva, Dr Tedros said: There are actions that the US government is taking... which were concerned are having a serious impact on global health. In particular he pointed to the suspension of PEPFAR, the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which he said had halted HIV treatment, testing and prevention services in 50 countries. He added that a reprieve for life-saving services had not stopped the disruption. Clinics are shuttered and health workers have been put on leave, Dr Tedros said. Experts in global health have warned of the spread of disease, as well as delays to the development of vaccines and new treatments as a result of the cuts. Trump has argued that USAID is incompetent and corrupt. He recently announced huge cuts to the agencys 10,000-strong workforce and the immediate suspension of almost all of its aid programmes. The agency spends about 40bn (32bn) - about 0.6 of total US yearly government spending - on humanitarian aid, much of which goes towards health programmes. The vast majority of USAID money is spent in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, where it is primarily used for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who is working on the White Houses effort to shrink the size of the federal government, has previously claimed that the aid agency is a criminal organisation. Neither Trump nor Musk have provided clear evidence to support their claims. As well as the freeze on USAID, President Trump has taken steps to withdraw the United States from the WHO. Under the Biden administration the US was the largest funder of the UNs health agency and in 2023 it contributed almost one-fifth of the agencys budget. Dr Tedros said Trumps decision was affecting collaboration between countries on global health threats. He also said the US had reduced its reporting of bird flu cases in humans. The WHO says it has employed emergency measures similar to those used during the Covid pandemic to fill the gaps where there are shortages - in life-saving antiretroviral medication, for example, which is used to treat people living with HIV. Meg Doherty, director of global HIV, hepatitis and sexually-transmitted infection (STI) programmes at the WHO, said efforts were being made to co-ordinate the sharing of ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj3z290ngyo,2025-03-08
How does the Covid inquiry work?,"The Covid inquiry is taking evidence from politicians, civil servants and health experts about the roll-out of vaccines and anti-viral treatment across the UK. In July 2024, the inquirys first report said the UKs flawed pandemic preparations had led to more deaths and greater economic damage than there should have been. Just under 227,000 people died in the UK from Covid between March 2020 and May 2023, when the World Health Organization said the global health emergency was over. The Covid inquiry was launched by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, more than a year after he said the governments actions would be put under the microscope. The announcement came after the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign said it was considering launching a judicial review over government time-wasting. Johnson said the inquiry would cover decision-making during the pandemic by the UK government, as well as the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first public hearings took place in London in June 2023. Subsequent hearings have been held in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Public inquiries are established and funded by the government and are led by an independent chair. They can compel witnesses to give evidence. No-one is found guilty or innocent, but the inquiry publishes conclusions and recommendations, which the government is not obliged to accept. Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers The inquiry is chaired by former judge and crossbench peer Baroness Hallett, who previously led the inquests into the 7 July London bombings. She said that loss and suffering would be at the heart of the inquiry, adding it would be firmly independent. Baroness Hallett promised the inquiry would be thorough and fair Baroness Hallett said the inquiry would examine how decisions on limiting the spread of Covid were made and communicated; the use of lockdowns and face coverings; and the impact on children, health and care sector workers, and the clinically vulnerable. She will also consider the effect on bereaved families, and how the findings could be applied to other national emergencies. Loss and suffering at heart of Covid inquiry Several reports are expected, covering everything from political decision-making to vaccines. Publishing the first of these in July 2024, Baroness Hallett said the UK was ill-prepared for dealing with a catastrophic emergency, let alone the coronavirus pandemic. Never again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering, she added. The 217-page report, external argued the UK planned for the wrong pandemic - a mild one where spread of a new virus was inevitable - and this led to the untested policy of lockdown. It said the UK government and devolved nations failed their citizens, and that ministers did not sufficiently challenge scientific experts. It made a series of recommendations for reforming the way the government approaches emergency planning across the four nations of t...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-57085964,2025-03-08
Large UK-wide pandemic preparedness tests planned this year,"Emergency service teams, local councils and government officials will take part in a full, multi-day pandemic preparedness exercise, to help the UK prepare for potential future threats. The test, which is likely to take place in the autumn, will involve thousands of people across different parts of the UK, minister Pat McFadden has announced. The plans come in response to the first set of recommendations made by the Covid-19 Inquiry - the ongoing public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The chair of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, found the UK was ill-prepared for the coronavirus pandemic, and failed its citizens. The national pandemic response exercise will be the first of its kind in nearly a decade, designed to test capabilities, plans and procedures in the face of new threats, the government says. The findings and lessons will be made public, as requested by Baroness Hallett, who made a series of recommendations in a 217-page report published in July 2023. Another measure will be a full test of the emergency alert system - which sounds an alarm through mobile phones - later this year. The alert has been used four times since its launch in 2023, including in areas hit hardest by recent storms. The government has also committed to training 4,000 people a year to be better prepared for crises such as pandemics, through a UK resilience academy, planned to open in April. The Covid-19 inquiry report found the pandemic had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups. A new national vulnerability map will be produced, Mr McFadden says, to highlight populations who may be vulnerable in a crisis, using data on age, disability, ethnicity and whether someone is receiving care. It is designed to help people get more targeted local support. Mr McFadden said: We must learn lessons from the Covid pandemic, as we cannot afford to make the same mistakes again. But we will plan in a way that recognises the next crisis may not be the same as the last. Pandemic planning and resilience are also about making sure the underlying fundamentals of the country are strong, he added. Baroness Halletts first report called for a major overhaul of the systems involved in preparing the country for civil emergencies. It also pointed out the UK lacked resilience, with high rates of ill-health and public services running close to - if not beyond - capacity.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj910k8g4l0o,2025-03-08
Families failed by Covid jabs tell inquiry of pain,"Families of those harmed by Covid vaccines told the UK Covid Inquiry they were forced to support each other during the pandemic because there was no other help. Kate Scott, who represents the group Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK (VIBUK), said they felt they were almost being pushed into the shadows during the pandemic. The inquiry also heard from a victims group in Scotland which raised concerns that the vaccine had been rolled out too quickly, and that safety had been sacrificed for speed. This is the Inquirys fourth module, which will consider issues relating to the development of Covid-19 vaccines and their implementation. Mrs Scott, whose husband Jamie was left severely disabled by a vaccine, said: We are an uncomfortable truth, but we are a truth and the truth is for everyone in our group - the vaccine caused serious harm and death. Jamie Scott, a father of two boys, worked in a high-powered job until he was severely injured by a Covid vaccine. He spent four weeks and five days in a coma and suffered an extremely rare, life-threatening side effect called VITT, or vaccine-induced immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Jamie survived, but suffered a significant brain injury, which affected his thinking processes. He is now partially blind and his wife says he will never live independently. Jamie has received 120,000 - the maximum payout from the governments Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. His wife, who is clear that neither of them is against vaccines, says he will never work again and that this is not a fair or adequate amount. The scheme is inadequate and inefficient - offers too little too late and to too few, she said. The inquiry heard that figures from a Freedom of Information request by VIBUK show that, as of 30 November 2024, victims and their families have made 17,519 claims to the scheme. Of these: Covid Inquiry chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett spoke with a trembling voice as she told Jean Rossiter, whose son Peter died after contracting Covid-19: I too am the mother of two sons of a similar age to Peter, so I can only imagine the pain and the grief that you are going through. Peter Rossiter was a highly talented, classical pianist who brought music to life while head of music in a school, Jean told the inquiry. However, despite being a key worker, he only received his first vaccine in May 2021 - five months after the first jab was given in the UK. That summer he was infected with Covid and became seriously ill, was admitted to intensive care in hospital but died on 11 August 2021. Peter had kept himself fit, said his mother Jean who helped set up the group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK. He followed the rules, we all did and it seems to us as parents that we did everything right and yet Peter lost his life still, as did so many of the families whore in our group, she said.

NHS hours from PPE running out in Covid - Hancock,"The NHS in England came within six or seven hours of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said. The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems. He stated there was never a national shortage of PPE for healthcare workers but in some places, they did run out - and it was awful. Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to learn the lessons of what went wrong and put in place better stockpiles for the future. Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations. On Thursday, the inquirys chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives. Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid. In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was petrified newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care. But while some hospitals in England came under extraordinary pressure, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added. Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020. Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Downs syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was left to die because of her disability. Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic. Of course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences, he said. He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times. But he added: What we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, people, according to these characteristics, arent going to be cared for. Thats what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control. Did people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic, he told the inquiry. Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said on balance he believed the government got the rules about right.

Covid inquiry told Treasury blocked NHS bed request,"Boris Johnsons government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said. Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been very disappointing. Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and build resilience going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said. The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress. Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covids impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK. Ms Pritchard served as NHS Englands chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021. In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020. The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients. But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime ministers private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector. And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021. She called the decision very disappointing, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in quite a different position today had the extra funding been agreed. If we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally, Ms Prichard said. In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals. That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of extreme pressure in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country. By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers. But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed to the brink and were right on the edge of running out of bed space. Nationally, the health service had never had to systematically limit access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said. That does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpwz3qyr0o,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry told top NHS doctor was terrified,"The most senior doctor in NHS England has said he was personally terrified that hospitals could have been overwhelmed in the early stages of the pandemic. Prof Sir Stephen Powis told the Covid inquiry officials had drawn up a draft document advising whose care should be prioritised if the NHS found itself unable to cope with the surge in patients. The Covid-19 decision tool assigned points based on a patients age, frailty and underlying conditions. A high score meant they might not be admitted to intensive care if services were overwhelmed. The tool was never issued publicly, after it became clear infections might have already reached a peak in March 2020. Sir Stephen, who still serves as national medical director at NHS England, said the senior clinicians who were asked to draw up the plans at short notice did a magnificent job that nobody ever wants to do. But it became absolutely clear to me that this was going to be controversial, and that it hadnt had the opportunity to be discussed more widely with patient groups, or with the public, he added. The draft document advised doctors to score Covid patients based on three criteria, using a frailty scale. It detailed how those with a total score of more than eight points should not be admitted to intensive care if services became overwhelmed. Patients aged 70 to 75 were to be automatically assigned four points, while those aged over 80 would receive six. Extra points would be added for chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes. People who were terminally ill, with a life expectancy of less than six months, would automatically be given nine points. Sir Stephen said work on the guidance document had started early in the pandemic, at a time when the number of patients in intensive care in England was doubling every 5-7 days. It was not clear that the public would respond to lockdown - they did wonderfully - but that wasnt clear at that point, he said. Frankly, I was personally terrified that the NHS was going to be overwhelmed. The project was halted on 28 March 2020, after it became clear the peak of the first Covid wave was approaching and the health service would not breach capacity. Sir Stephen said there was also a danger the point-scoring system could have been used inappropriately, replacing the individual clinical judgement of doctors. My recommendation to the inquiry is that we should absolutely, in the future, not try and develop one of these tools in the midst of a pandemic, he added. He said it was a piece of work that needed to be carried out in consultation with the public in normal times. In my view, its a discussion that shouldnt be government-led, it shouldnt even be led by the profession, it needs to be located within society.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0gdzdv53yo,2025-03-08
How close were hospitals to collapse in Covid?,"Five times Prof Kevin Fong broke down in tears in a nondescript hearing room in West London, while giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. The 53-year-old has the kind of CV that makes you pay attention: a consultant anaesthetist in London who also works for the air ambulance service and specialises in space medicine. In 2020, as Covid spread around the world, he was seconded to NHS England and sent out to the worst hit areas to support other medics. Weve long been told that hospitals were struggling to cope during the pandemic. In January 2021, then prime minister Boris Johnson warned the NHS was under unprecedented pressure. But now many hours of testimony to the Covid inquiry this autumn is offering our clearest understanding yet of what was really going on at the height of the pandemic. The inquiry restarts its live hearings this week with evidence from doctors and patient groups. Health ministers and senior NHS managers are also expected to appear before the end of the year. I was at the inquiry the day Prof Fong calmly talked through more than 40 visits he led to intensive care units, his voice cracking at times. What Prof Fong discovered at the hospitals he visited was something he said could not be found in the official NHS data or the main evening news bulletins at the time. It really was like nothing else Ive ever seen, he said. These people were used to seeing death but not on that scale, and not like that. In late 2020, for example, he was sent to a midsize district hospital somewhere in England that was bursting at the seams. This was just as the second wave of Covid was hitting its peak. England was days away from its third national lockdown. The first vaccines were being rolled out but not yet in large numbers. In that hospital, he found the intensive care unit, the overflow areas and the respiratory wards all full with Covid patients. The previous night someone had died in an ambulance outside waiting to be admitted. The same thing had happened that morning. The staff were in total bits. Some of the nurses were wearing adult nappies or using patient commodes because there wasnt time for toilet breaks. One told him: It was overwhelming, the things we would normally do to help people didnt work. It was too much. That night, Prof Fong and his team helped to transfer 17 critically ill patients to other NHS sites  an emergency measure unheard of outside the pandemic. It is the closest I have ever seen a hospital to being in a state of operational collapse, he said. It was just a scene from hell. In the pandemic we heard reports of swamped hospitals in danger of being overwhelmed though to what extent was never fully clear. On the face of it bed occupancy in England  thats the total number of hospital beds taken up by all patients  did not hit more than 90 in January 2021, the peak of the largest Covid wave. Thats above the 85 level considered safe but not any higher than a typical winter outside the pandemic. That doesnt tell the full st...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78dl0xv7y2o,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry told of trust do-not-resuscitate rule,"At least one NHS trust put in place a blanket do-not-resuscitate order for sick patients in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has heard. It would mean individuals were considered ineligible for potentially lifesaving CPR, solely on the basis of age or disability, without being individually assessed. Former Resuscitation Council UK president Prof Jonathan Wyllie said he knew of one trust implementing the policy, although he had not seen a document setting it out. Groups representing the families of people who died from Covid said they were horrified but not surprised. Under NHS guidance, a Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNCPR) order can be added to someones medical notes after consultation with the patient or their family members. It means medical staff will not attempt chest compressions or defibrillation, where an electric shock is applied to restore normal heart rhythm, if the patients heart or breathing stops. Only 15-20 of those who have CPR in hospital survive, with success rates dropping to 5-10 outside of a hospital setting. Groups representing bereaved families believe some hospital departments became so overwhelmed in the pandemic that blanket DNACPR rules were applied, based solely on age, disability or medical condition. At the time, the charity Mencap said some people with learning disabilities had reported being told they would not be resuscitated if taken ill with Covid. NHS England says a blanket DNACPR rule for every person with a specific medical condition or over a certain age would be unlawful. It wrote to NHS trusts a number of times during the pandemic, to remind clinicians the orders should only ever be applied with the appropriate consent. Prof Wyllie told the inquiry he had not seen a document from the NHS trust concerned but had heard about the policy from a fellow member of the Resuscitation Council. The charity, which develops guidelines and training for medical staff, had then released a very clear public statement that blanket DNACPR orders were not an appropriate way forward and should not be implemented. That was our stance and that has never changed, Prof Wyllie added. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said the use of blanket policies would be irrefutable evidence some NHS services had been overwhelmed in the pandemic. The inquiry has heard repeatedly from those at the top that blanket DNACPRs were not appropriate and that there was no directive in place, the groups solicitor Nicola Brook said. The bereaved families have known for a long time that the realities on the ground were very different. Their worst fears have now been confirmed but this brings with it more questions, If it happened at this trust, did it happen at the trust where my loved one was?",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd98vpxgp7ko,2025-03-08
"We were not treated as parents, Covid inquiry told","A mother of premature twins has told the Covid inquiry she did not feel like she was treated as a parent after giving birth in the early stages of the pandemic. Tamsin Mullen said she was kept in a side room for 27 hours after giving birth by caesarean section while her sons were taken to neonatal intensive care. She said rigid visiting restrictions meant that, for the next month, only one parent was allowed to visit her newborn babies at a time. We needed the hospital to understand we were a family, she told the inquiry. We didnt feel like a mother and father to our children in the way we should have done. The Covid inquiry has been taking evidence about the impact on maternity services as part of its third section, or module, which is investigating the impact on the NHS and healthcare. Ms Mullen, a mother of three, was giving first-hand impact evidence on behalf of 13 pregnancy, baby and parent organisations. She found out she was expecting twin boys in 2019 and was considered high-risk. When pregnant with her first child, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia - a condition which can cause high blood pressure and lead to serious complications. Her pregnancy was being monitored closely with scans every week because of concerns about the development of one of the babies. Initially she said her husband was able to come with her to scanning appointments, but as Covid spread in March 2020, he was forced to wait in the car park outside after driving 50 miles from their home to the nearest hospital. It was just before the first lockdown came into effect, she said. I was very nervous. It was very difficult to do that alone knowing the pregnancy was high-risk. In April 2020, Ms Mullens two sons were born prematurely, at 34 weeks, by caesarean section. Her husband was able to be with her in the operating theatre and then in the recovery room for an hour, before being told Covid restrictions meant he had to leave. Their two young boys then spent a total of 31 days in neonatal intensive care before they could be discharged. Ms Mullen said Covid restrictions meant only one parent could be with them at a time, even after they had been moved to a single room away from other babies. The hospital had shut off access to side rooms used for breastfeeding and Ms Mullen said she was told to use a toilet to express milk, something she did not want to do because of the infection risk. She said the restrictions were baffling when both parents lived together and were driving to hospital each morning in the same car. She was looking after both babies by herself in intensive care when hospital staff from outside the unit told her they had tested positive for a bacterial infection called MRSA. I was holding our son who was on oxygen at the time, she said. I was in a state of shock so didnt really say very much. They the staff left me and I was there on my own. I didnt know what it all meant, so I really panicked. Later a doctor explained the form of MRSA involved was a less...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70z1ppyv5eo,2025-03-08
Covid ambulance crews faced 'crucial PPE delays',"Ambulance crews faced crucial delays trying to save dying patients in the pandemic because of the time it took to put on protective equipment, the Covid inquiry has been told. Ambulance technician Mark Tilley appeared close to tears when he described how the experience still played on his mind. I bottle things away. Im told quite a lot of times Im cold. I just deal with it in the way that I deal with it, he said. During the pandemic, some ambulance staff moved into budget hotels for weeks at a time to avoid putting family members in danger, he added. Mr Tilley, who works for South East Coast Ambulance Service, was giving evidence as a representative of the GMB union. In January 2021, at the peak of the winter wave of the pandemic, he volunteered to move to Sittingbourne, in north Kent, for three weeks, along with 40 colleagues. A new variant of Covid which appeared to transmit more quickly had recently emerged in the area, and hospitals were coming under increased pressure. He told the inquiry that, on one occasion, he had to queue in his ambulance outside AE for an entire ten-hour shift because there was not enough room to transfer a heavily deteriorating patient into the building. Wed run out of oxygen, so wed had to scan the hospital to try and find more, he said. We ordered pizza to the vehicle because otherwise we wouldnt have had anything to eat. Because of lockdown rules at the time, volunteer ambulance crews were sleeping in a budget hotel, with some deciding not to return home to avoid placing family members in danger. You had nowhere to go, so it was just the facilities that were there: the television and a phone, he said. You had 12 hours after your shift to mull over what youd been seeing; the queues at the hospital, the poor patients. In his testimony, Mr Tilley described arriving at residential homes where patients were dying inside the front window or on the pathway. Under guidance, paramedics and other ambulance staff were told they had to wait until arriving at the scene before they could put on plastic Tyvek suits and protective hoods or masks. He said that could cost crews a crucial minute and a half before they were able to start treatment: I would have normally gone over and started bouncing up and down on their chest to perform CPR. But instead we went and got our masks and suits on and all of that  that plays on my mind all the time. For me, you cant change history no matter what you talk about, its history. We cant change it. Counsel to the inquiry Alice Hands said research commissioned by the inquiry had revealed similar accounts, with other ambulance crews saying they were forced not to intervene and watch people die while they put on equipment. In his evidence, Anthony Marsh, national ambulance adviser to NHS England and former chairman of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said he was aware of those concerns at the time and did raise the matter with senior colleagues. But he said allowing crews to put on PP...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw0vrrqnno,2025-03-08
"Covid was like a daily terror attack, doctor tells inquiry","Treating patients during the pandemic was like responding to a daily terror attack, the Covid inquiry has heard. Giving testimony, Professor Kevin Fong, spoke of staff he met during a hospital visit being in total bits. The former national clinical adviser in emergency preparedness at NHS England recalled a conversation with an intensive care doctor during a visit in December 2020. I asked him immediately what things had been like and Ill never forget, he replied its been like a terrorist attack every day since it started, and we dont know when the attacks are going to stop. Prof Fong described Covid as the biggest national emergency this country has faced since World War Two, and repeatedly broke down in tears on the stand while describing what he had seen and his conversations with other staff members. During the pandemic, Prof Fong, a consultant anaesthetist, conducted around 40 visits of the hardest hit intensive care units on behalf of NHS England to offer peer support to the doctors and nurses working there. He wrote reports which were sent back to senior managers including Englands chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. He said the scale of death was very difficult to capture in the figures. It was truly, truly astounding We had nurses talking about patients raining from the sky, where one of the nurses told me they got tired of putting people in body bags. We went to another unit where things got so bad they were so short of resources, they ran out of body bags and instead were stuck with nine-foot clear plastic sacks and cable ties. These are people who are used to seeing death but not on that scale and not like that. Prof Fong said that despite the best efforts of everyone in the system the surge of demand for healthcare caused by Covid meant it was not possible to deliver the standard of care that would ordinarily be expected. He described the situation as the worst he had witnessed: I was on the scene of the Soho bombing in 1999, I worked in the emergency department during the 7th July suicide bombing with the helicopter medical service. And nothing I saw during all of those events was as bad as really Covid was every single day for every single one of these hospitals through the pandemic surges. Its painful now because it was very clear what was happening to the patients, it was very clear what was happening to the staff. The staff were very injured by just how overwhelmed they were by the whole thing. In December 2020 as Covid rates were rising again across the UK, he said he was asked to visit an unnamed hospital with a medium-sized intensive care unit. Ill never forget it, he said. It was a scene from hell. This was a hospital in massive, massive trouble.... there were so few staff that some of the nurses had chosen to either use the patient commodes or wear adult diapers because there was literally no one to give them a toilet break, he added. This was a hospital breaking at the seams. At the end of his evidence, he was tha...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9py388z17o,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry rejects clinicians’ anonymity plea,"The chair of the Covid inquiry has refused an application from the UK Health Security Agency to keep the identities of two junior clinicians secret. Lawyers for UKHSA applied for an order preventing publication of their names, on the grounds they could be subject to abuse and harassment on social media and in person. Both individuals attended Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Cell meetings to discuss the guidance on masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Baroness Hallett ruled their names could be published in minutes of those meetings, as any risk was outweighed by the public interest in reporting on the groups work. From February 2020 until it was disbanded in 2022, guidance on the use of PPE in healthcare settings was drawn up by the IPC Cell, a group of clinicians and officials from the NHS, government and public-health bodies such as Public Health England, which then Health Secretary Matt Hancock replaced with UKHSA in 2021. Critics have said the IPC Cell was too slow to strengthen its recommendations on PPE after it became clear Covid could be spread by tiny airborne particles. The Covid-19 Airborne Transmission Alliance (CATA), a group made up of healthcare organisations and individuals which campaigned for stronger guidance, has called it a shadowy organisation with unclear accountability structures. UKHSA said the heated and aggressive public discourse around the subject meant there was a high likelihood junior members of staff could face online abuse if they were named in minutes published by the inquiry. One social media post from 2022 accused the IPC Cell of having the blood of many innocent Covid victims on its hands, adding: We shall not forgive. We shall not forget. Another, from early 2022, called the group psychopaths, pure and simple. In her ruling, Baroness Hallett said she deprecated attacks and abuse of this kind on any public servant doing their job. But work of the IPC Cell was important to her investigation and the public should be able to assess the evidence in full, including the names and qualifications of those involved in meetings. On balance, I am not persuaded that there is an objective risk of harm or damage to the applicants should their identities be published, she said. Eight media organisations led by the Guardian newspaper had argued there was a public interest in knowing who had been involved in decision-making at the time. The abuse of scientists, medics and other officials involved in the pandemic response has been a theme running through the Covid inquiry. Last week, Englands chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, Dame Ruth May, spoke about the impact of pretty horrible comments online. Sometimes you have to make decisions, or be involved in decisions that mean that, on social media in particular, you are vilified, she said. In June 2023, Englands chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said in his evidence that abuse and threats aimed at independent scientists could ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07n8zp9zp0o,2025-03-08
Warning tax rises could force care homes to close,"Tax rises and higher staffing costs announced in the Budget could force some care homes to close, providers have warned. Social care will be hit by a hike in the rate of National Insurance contributions paid by employers as well as increases to the minimum wage. The sector welcomed an extra 600m in funding to local authorities for adult and childrens social care. But care groups said this would not be enough and would be wiped off instantly by increased staffing costs. The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to exempt social care from the rise in National Insurance. The party said the chancellor had provided extra funding for the NHS and other public sector organisations to cover the cost of the tax rise - but because the vast majority of care providers are private they would not benefit from this. Speaking to BBC Radio 4s World at One programme, Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirmed the NHS would be refunded for the rise in National Insurance contributions. However, pressed on whether private social care companies would still have to pay the increased rate, he pointed to the extra 600m allocated for the sector. The chancellor has taken into account those pressures when making funding decisions, he added. Care England, which represents adult social care providers, said without further support the sector was in unprecedented danger and the closure of services that were no longer viable was likely. It said the 600m in funding was a drop in the ocean compared to the staggering 2.4bn in rising costs associated with wage increases and employer national insurance contributions. Mike Padgham runs five residential and nursing homes in North Yorkshire supporting older and disabled people. He has 210 staff, and his current wage bill is 5.3m a year. He estimates each month the increase in employers National Insurance will cost an extra 5,000, and the increase in the minimum wage will add another 25,000. Most of his residents are funded by the local authority and Mr Padgham says he will have to ask for higher fees. But care providers have long complained financially squeezed councils do not pay enough to cover the real costs of care. Mr Padgham, who chairs the Independent Care Group, which represents independent providers, said that as a labour-intensive sector an increase in employee costs was the last thing social care needed. For a lot of providers this will place existential pressure on them and could well push some out of business, unless it is matched by extra funding to those who commission care and there was little sign of that, he said. He said the extra 600m for social care would have little or no impact once shared between 152 local authorities and childrens services. He added: Any extra funding that might reach providers will be wiped off instantly by the increases in National Insurance and minimum pay which will together heap further pressure on social care providers.

"High-grade masks evidence weak, Covid inquiry told","There is only weak evidence that high-grade face masks better protected health workers than surgical ones in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has been told. Prof Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said respirator masks  known as FFP3s  may have performed no better than thin surgical masks in real-life situations. She said there could be significant harms from wearing tight-fitting FFP3s, including blisters and breathing difficulties. If the evidence was strong that FFP3s really protected people, and we saw a definitive reduction in infections, they would have been recommended, she said. Not all scientists agree on what has become a controversial issue. The BBC has previously reported on research which appears to show a significant real-world benefit from wearing higher-grade masks on hospital wards. Throughout the first two years of the pandemic, groups representing doctors, nurses and other health workers repeatedly called for urgent improvements to personal protective equipment (PPE), including the wider use of respirators. FFP3s are tight-fitting masks with a built-in air filter designed to block out tiny aerosol particles which can carry the virus. Before they can be used, each wearer must undergo a fit test, to make sure the mask is properly sealed to the face. For most of the pandemic, national guidance across the whole UK said that healthcare workers should wear basic surgical masks rather than FFP3s, except in intensive care or a small number of medical situations. The decision was heavily criticised by some staff with the doctors union, the BMA, calling it a matter of life and death. National guidance on face masks from April 2020 was drawn up by a group of experts from across the United Kingdom known as the IPC (Infection Prevention and Control) Cell. Its membership included representatives from the NHS, government departments and health bodies, including Public Health England (PHE), the organisation replaced by UKHSA in 2021 in a shake-up ordered by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock. The inquiry was shown minutes from an IPC Cell meeting on 22 December 2020, just after the new Alpha variant of Covid had been detected, which appeared to show disagreement about the use of higher-grade FFP3 masks. The records quote Dr Colin Brown, now the deputy director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA but at the time with PHE, as saying: Our understanding of aerosol transmission has changed. A precautionary approach to move to FFP3 masks in all healthcare settings whilst we are awaiting evidence should be advised. However, the wider IPC Cell decided that no upgrading of the guidance was warranted at the time, and NHS trusts were told to continue to supply staff with standard surgical masks in almost all cases outside intensive care. It was not until January 2022 that the advice changed, saying that FFP3 respirators should be available to all relevant staff depending on a risk assessment.

"Nurses bore the brunt of Covid, ex-chief nurse says","Nurses bore the brunt of the pandemic, with low staffing levels and difficulties accessing protective equipment, according to Englands former chief nurse. Dame Ruth May told the Covid inquiry the NHS had been understaffed in 2020, in part because of the catastrophic decision to cut financial support for student nurses in 2015. Resources had been stretched, particularly in intensive care, she said, with a knock-on effect on the care some Covid patients received. And she had been aware of widespread reports of problems supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) in March 2020, including a shortage of plastic gowns that had left front-line nurses living in fear. Dame Ruth, Englands chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, was one of the senior figures who appeared at Downing Street news conferences during the pandemic. She had also volunteered for nursing shifts during Covid, at times working under the radar in hospital wards, the inquiry heard. We were facing some extraordinarily difficult decisions in the very early part of pandemic, she said. It was a fast-moving environment - we were seeing a large number of cases coming in and deaths like we had never seen before. The NHS had entered the pandemic with about 40,000 nursing and midwifery vacancies in England, Dame Ruth said. And she criticised a catastrophic decision, in 2015, to replace the grant or bursary paid to student midwives and nurses with loans. It had led to reduction of about 5,700 trainees in England by 2020, Dame Ruth said, which would have made a difference in the pandemic. There would have been less burnout - there would have been less psychological impact, she said. Intensive-care units came under such pressure during Covid specialist critical-care nurses were responsible for up to six patients each instead of the usual one-to-one ratio. And Dame Ruth accepted that had affected the care patients received, saying: It was not where we wanted to go... and I know there have been consequences because of it. Blanket do-not-resuscitate orders had appeared to have been added to some patients records based on either their age or a pre-existing condition such as autism or a learning disability, she told the inquiry, which had been completely wrong. Dame Ruth also suggested it had been a mistake for some hospitals to prevent pregnant women from being accompanied by their partners during scans or the early part of labour. The faster rollout of Covid tests would have allowed visitors to come back into hospital earlier and been safer for staff and patients, she said. Dame Ruth also spoke about the pretty horrible online abuse she had faced at the time. The one thing I learned about the whole of this period, is the importance of integrity - and sometimes that comes at a cost, she said. That means on social media in particular you are vilified - but I wasnt the only one.

‘I grieve for the person I was before' - Covid inquiry to begin new phase,"The public inquiry into the pandemic will start 10 weeks of hearings on Monday looking at the impact on patients, healthcare workers and the wider NHS. Covid patients have been admitted to hospital more than a million times in the UK since the virus emerged in 2020, while countless others have had care for other conditions disrupted. The third stage of the inquiry will also examine the impact on NHS staff, the use of masks and PPE in hospitals, the policy of shielding the most vulnerable and the treatment of long Covid. And for the first time, the stories of more than 30,000 healthcare staff, patients and relatives will form part of the material entered into evidence. BBC News has spoken to some of them. It was absolutely horrendous. We were really struggling, having to scrounge around for masks and gloves, says Mandi Masters, a community midwife from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. At that early stage the NHS was, she says, working in the dark as the virus spread from China to Italy and then to the UK. Mandi later caught Covid herself  she is convinced at work  and ended up in hospital on oxygen for three weeks. My husband took me to AE but had to leave me there, turn around and walk away, she says. The news was coming out on how many health professionals were dying of Covid, but I was just too poorly to care at that point, she says. Looking back, I have to admit, it was extremely frightening. Mandi, 62, has now returned to work part-time, but still struggles to catch her breath after a short walk. Every cold or chest infection wipes her out and she grieves for the person I was before Covid. The third section of the Covid public inquiry will look in detail at the effect on healthcare workers. It will also cover: It has to examine the impact on the wider healthcare system, including the sharp increase in delays and waiting lists triggered by the pandemic. Lynda Ross, from Portadown, was booked in for spinal surgery in early 2020. Her operation was cancelled and, by the time she could see her specialist again, she was told it was too late for treatment. The consequence of that is I have to live my life in a level of pain that has me on the same medication as someone who is dying from cancer. she says. It feels like the rest of my life has been destroyed. More than 50 witnesses are expected to give evidence over the next 10 weeks, including scientists, medical experts, healthcare workers and politicians. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which represents more than 7,000 relatives, says it is deeply worried that only two of the 23 witnesses it has put forward have been called to appear.

Corruption review finds 'red flags' in more than 130 Covid contracts,"An anti-corruption charity says it has identified significant concerns in contracts worth over 15.3bn awarded by the Conservative government during the Covid pandemic, equivalent to one in every 3 spent. Transparency International UK found 135 high-risk contracts with at least three red flags - warning signs of a risk of corruption. Twenty-eight contracts worth 4.1bn went to firms with known political connections, while 51 worth 4bn went through a VIP lane for companies recommended by MPs and peers, a practice the High Court ruled was unlawful. A Conservative spokesperson said: Government policy was in no way influenced by the donations the party received  they are entirely separate. Transparency International UK analysed 5,000 contracts for red flags. The charity said its analysis also indicated that almost two thirds of high-value contracts to supply items such as masks and protective medical equipment during the pandemic, adding up to a total of 30.7bn, were awarded without any competition. A further eight contracts worth a total of 500m went to suppliers no more than 100 days old  another red flag for corruption. Normal safeguards designed to protect the process of bidding for government contracts from corruption were suspended during the pandemic. The government, led by Boris Johnson, justified this at the time by stressing the need to short-cut the bidding process to accelerate the supply of much-needed items such as personal protective equipment (PPE). But Transparency International UK, a core participant in the Covid-19 inquiry which begins its third module on Monday, said the suspension of normal safeguards was often unjustifiable, costing the public purse billions and eroding trust in political institutions. It is urging the authorities to investigate the high-risk contracts it has identified. The charity said it has written to the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee and Chancellor Rachel Reeves with a detailed overview of the findings and the contracts involved. Chief executive Daniel Bruce said: That we find multiple red flags in more than 15bn of contacts, amounting to a third of all such spending, points to more than coincidence or incompetence. He added that the Covid procurement response was marked by various points of systemic weakness and political choices that allowed cronyism to thrive, all enabled by woefully inadequate public transparency. As far as we can ascertain, no other country used a system like the UKs VIP lane in their Covid response. The cost to the public purse has already become increasingly clear with huge sums lost to unusable PPE from ill-qualified suppliers, Mr Bruce continued. We strongly urge the Covid-19 inquiries and planned Covid corruption commissioner to ensure full accountability and for the new government to swiftly implement lessons learned. Of a total of 48.1bn of public money spent on private sector contracts related to the Covid-19 pandemic, 14.9bn was written off by the Departme...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevj3y7n33vo,2025-03-08
How the UK planned for the wrong pandemic,"Even as Covid hit, the government and its health officials were bullish in their confidence about their ability to cope. Dr Jenny Harries, then the deputy chief medical officer for England, hailed the UK as an international exemplar in its preparedness at one of the early TV press conferences. She was not the only one who thought like this  after all, just a year before the pandemic a government review had praised our world-leading capabilities. But such a belief, said Baroness Hallett as she set out the first of her Covid reports, was dangerously mistaken. The UK had, in fact, prepared for the wrong pandemic. How did this happen? Across 217 pages and more than 80,000 words, Baroness Hallett has set out a detailed and damning critique of how a decade of over-confidence, wasted opportunities and muddled-thinking left the UK sleep-walking into a pandemic that went on to claim more than 200,000 lives and cause long-lasting damage to the economy and society. The initial cause of it can be traced back to 2009 and the swine flu pandemic. It was another virus that quickly swept the globe, but it turned out to be mild, partly because older people seemed to have some immunity because of previous exposure to a similar strain. Baroness Halletts report said that lulled the UK into a false sense of security. Two years later a new pandemic plan was produced. That strategy was not based on trying to heavily suppress the pandemic virus - instead it was about mitigating its inevitable spread in the belief the impacts would be mild. Because the strategy was based on flu, there was hope vaccines could be quickly deployed and, in the meantime, antiviral drugs could be used to lessen the severity of illness. But Covid was not flu  and certainly not a mild flu. The nine years from 2011 up to the start of the Covid pandemic are also littered with missed opportunities. The UK did not learn from east Asian countries like Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. They had used their experience of other coronavirus outbreaks, of Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and Sars (Severe acute respiratory syndrome), to put in place plans to quickly scale-up test and trace systems and introduce quarantine processes. Border control measures, including travel restrictions and testing, could also deployed. In contrast, the UK abandoned community testing in spring 2020 just as Covid was taking off. In his evidence for this module, Jeremy Hunt, who was health secretary from 2012 to 2018, went as far as to say that if we had learned from abroad we could even have avoided the first lockdown. But its not as if there was no attempt to learn lessons. In the 2010s, a number of training events were held, simulating both flu and coronavirus outbreaks, to stress-test the UKs preparedness. One event in 2016 called Exercise Cygnus identified worryingly large gaps in the response and plans were put in place to update those by 2018. But that did not happen, and by June 2020 just eight of the 22 recomm...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9472qxk1vo,2025-03-08
Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers,"Hearings have begun in the public inquiry, external scrutinising the UKs response to, and impacts of, the coronavirus pandemic. As the virus spread, government agencies increasingly published figures on case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths. To follow alongside the inquiry, the BBCs data team has broken down some of these statistics into key areas from the beginning of the pandemic up to 5 May 2023, when the World Health Organisation declared an end to the virus as a global health emergency, external. Just under 227,000 people died in the UK with Covid-19 listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. This includes those who had not been tested for the virus prior to their death. The most deaths reported in this way on a single day was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people were registered. At this point in the pandemic, the first variant of the virus seen in the UK - initially detected in Kent - was dominant. This was subsequently named the Alpha variant by the WHO. The UK was also only a month into the first stages of its vaccine rollout, which started to reduce the risk of death and serious illness from the virus. Another way of looking at the impact coronavirus had on the number of people dying in the UK is by counting all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began, sometimes referred to excess deaths, external. As of 5 May 2023, this was over 208,000 deaths. For most of the previous three years there were above average levels of deaths in the UK. LIVE: Follow the latest updates from the Covid inquiry What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take? How inquiry is exposing deep flaws in Covid decision-making What to do if you have Covid: Can you go to work or school? The highest peaks in the first two years of the pandemic were during periods when many people died directly from Covid. Out of nearly 13,000 excess deaths in mid-April 2020, about 9,500 were attributed to the virus. But a larger portion of the excess seen in the second half of 2022 were driven by other factors, including flu and pressure on the NHS. Of the 3,300 excess deaths in mid-January 2023, about 600 were from Covid. Compared with other countries, over the three years to February 2023, the UKs death rates went up by more than 5, which was more than France, Germany and Spain (all up between 3 and 4.5), but by less than Italys (up more than 6). The US and Eastern European countries like Poland were even harder hit, with death rates more than 10 above their pre-pandemic levels over the three years to February 2023. More than 44 million people in the UK, external were estimated to have had the virus between April 2020 and February 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the most accurate measure available as the total number of infections across the country will never be known. The ONS ran a regular survey through the pandemic: testing randomly chosen people in order to estimate the number of people who had...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,2025-03-08
First place in British Isles set to approve right to die,"A law to give terminally ill adults on the Isle of Man the right to end their own lives is entering its final stages, making it potentially the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying. Anyone over the age of 18 and with a prognosis of 12 months or fewer to live would be eligible, under the legislation being debated in the Manx parliament. The bill will not be passed yet, since the Isle of Mans lower house has rejected an amendment that would have meant people would only need residency on the island for one year to take advantage of the legislation. The House of Keys continued to insist on five-year residency and have sent the legislation back to the upper house. The move comes as MPs in Westminster are scrutinising a bill that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. People on the Isle of Man eligible to request assisted dying would have to: The measures have been a matter of strong debate in Tynwald, the islands parliament. It is likely the bill will receive Royal Assent and become law, with the scheme possibly up and running by 2027. Jersey - a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man which can make its own laws - is also moving ahead with legislation to establish an assisted dying service. Former GP Dr Alex Allinson introduced the private members bill to Tynwald and has been pivotal in ushering it through the legislative process. He hopes this will be the last time it will need to be debated by the directly elected chamber. The passage of this bill has been a long and careful process starting in 2022 and has been properly consulted on, scrutinised and put through a full parliamentary process, Dr Allinson says. It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death. Among the key clauses in the most recent version of the bill are measures on age and length of prognosis. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, is currently being scrutinised by MPs in Westminster. If passed it would become law in England and Wales. It has some similarities to the Isle of Man legislation - people must be terminally ill, over 18 and registered with a GP. Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure. The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months. The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerlands Dignitas clinic. On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ed70qep7o,2025-03-08
Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people,"At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryans previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms. Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day. You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years, he says. Youd die. He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24, says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence. We have seen young people under the age of 25 whove completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal, says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou. In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024. And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11 of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4 in 2013 to 0.9 in 2023. The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities. And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine  also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is ofte...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0g2gnjrqo,2025-03-08
Assisted dying bill: What is in proposed law?,"MPs have voted in favour of proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will now face many more months of debate and scrutiny by MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament needed for it to become law. It is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all. The bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life. But there are requirements: Under the bill, a doctor could prepare the approved substance (the bill does not detail what medication this is) but the person themselves must take it. No doctor or anyone else would be allowed to administer the medication to the terminally ill person. The doctor would stay with the person until they had self-administered the substance and died (or the doctor determines the procedure has failed). The person could decide not to take it, in which case the doctor would have to remove the substance immediately. Doctors would also not be under any obligation to take part in the assisted dying process. This is called physician-assisted suicide. Voluntary euthanasia is different and is where a health professional administers the drugs to the patient. Deaths covered by the assisted suicide bill would not need to be investigated by a coroner. But the bill would make it illegal for someone to pressure, coerce or use dishonesty to get someone to make a declaration that they wish to end their life or to induce someone to self-administer an approved substance. If someone is found guilty of either of these actions, they could face a jail sentence of up to 14 years. Whats not included in the bill is how much the system would cost, who would pay and what the workload would be. And there is no detail about the judicial process - namely, how the evidence would be put before the High Court judge. Lord Thomas, former Lord Chief Justice, told the BBCs Today Programme that it cannot be a rubber stamping process and judges must be satisfied there is no coercion. The person seeking assisted dying would be advised to consider telling their family and GP, but would not legally have to. The law would apply to England and Wales. A separate bill is already under discussion in Scotland. Meanwhile, politicians in Jersey and the Isle of Man have already backed plans to introduce assisted dying and the process to bring in legislation is under way.",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l7m6r55do,2025-03-08
'My first cervical screening was over before I knew it',"People not knowing about options to make their cervical screening easier and more comfortable is costing lives, a cancer charity warned last month. To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months. Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99 of cervical cancers. During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix. This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish theyd known beforehand. Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite. I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that, she says. When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more comfortable and casual, she says. Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening for at least two years because of concerns about pain. But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January. Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could. Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be uncomfortable and painful. But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didnt find this to be the case. Jessica Tse was really anxious before her cervical screening in December. I didnt know if it was going to hurt, she says. But the nurse was talking to me, distracting me throughout and explained the procedure really clearly, she adds. Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadnt felt before, Bianca recalls. But it was over before I knew, she says. Others say they didnt experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton. It was nothing, says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. I couldnt feel anything. She says the fact shed already had two children made her less anxious about the experience. These nurses have seen everything, Megan adds. Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says youre there to do a job, you dont care about these things. While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments.

How are the vaping rules changing?,"The government is tightening up the rules about how vapes are marketed and sold, alongside wider plans to tackle health issues caused by smoking. A ban on disposable vapes will also be introduced and a new tax on nicotine vapes put in place. The governments Tobacco and Vapes Bill proposes to outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship, external, and to restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products. Outdoor vaping may also be banned in smoke-free places, subject to consultation. Separately, the government had already announced that disposable vapes will be banned in England, Wales and Scotland from 1 June 2025. Northern Ireland is expected to follow suit. The move is designed to protect children and young peoples health, and to reduce environmental damage. It covers single-use vapes which cannot be refilled or recharged, external. Previous Conservative government plans to limit vaping and smoking had not become law by the time of the July general election, so Labour has brought in its own legislation. How will the UK smoking ban work? Vaping products are already subject to 20 VAT but, unlike tobacco, they do not attract a separate additional tax. As part of the Autumn Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that a vaping products duty will start on 1 October 2026. It will be charged at a flat rate of 2.20 per 10ml vaping liquid. At the same time, tobacco duty will be increased to preserve the financial incentive to switch to vaping. Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes. However, health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as it may cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains. The vapour inhaled contains a small amount of chemicals, often including the addictive substance nicotine. More research is needed to fully understand their health effects, but in December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that alarming evidence about the risks they pose was growing, external. Illegal vapes are also widely available and are much more likely to contain other harmful chemicals or drugs. Cigarettes contain tobacco, tar and a range of other toxic cancer-causing chemicals, and are one of the largest preventable causes of illness and death in the UK, external. That is why smokers are urged to stop, with nicotine vapes the most effective quit tool - better than nicotine patches or gum., external Research suggests people using vapes alongside face-to-face support can be up to twice as likely to stop smoking, external than those using other methods. But because vaping is not harmless, it is only recommended for adult smokers, who are offered free vape kits on the NHS to help them quit as part of its swap to stop programme.

Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines?,"There is nothing in life that is free of risk. That includes vaccines. But the evidence is compelling that the benefits of getting immunised with those vaccines recommended in the UK far outweigh the possibility of serious side effects. The level of benefit from Covid vaccines is well documented. And the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving more lives in the first year of its use than any other - 6.3m globally compared to 5.9m for PfizerBioNTechs jab. However, we need to discuss not just the huge positives that Covid vaccines brought, but also the small minority left injured or bereaved by the AstraZeneca vaccine. Around 50 families affected by rare blood clots have begun a group legal action for compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, arguing that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect. This includes people who have been left with severe physical injuries, those who are unable to work, and bereaved families who lost a loved one due to vaccine damage. They are a tiny fraction of all those vaccinated, but that is no comfort to the families affected, who feel like they have been airbrushed out of the pandemic and that their pleas for support have been ignored. Those families include Jane and Ian Wrigley from Buckinghamshire. Jane, 62, used to run, ski and climb mountains. Now she can barely walk due to extreme weakness down her left-hand side. Two weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021, Jane was admitted to hospital. She suffered blood clots in her brain and required emergency surgery to remove part of her skull. Janes medical records clearly state that she suffered these blood clots as a direct side effect of the vaccine. Her husband Ian is now her full-time carer. Jane told me: Before I had the vaccine I was a very independent, active woman doing half marathons and enjoying my life. Now Ive lost every bit of independence. Her case, and those of others affected by blood clots, raises serious questions about whether the system is letting down those who have suffered serious harm as a result of taking Covid vaccines. Almost 25m adults in the UK received a first dose of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine in 2021, and nearly all those had a second. It is estimated that the Covid vaccine programme prevented over a quarter of a million hospital admissions and over 120,000 deaths in the UK up to September 2021. The side effects of vaccination are usually mild and short-lived such as a sore arm, fever and fatigue. However, in the very rare event that something goes seriously wrong, we have a right to expect that we will be supported. This is a kind of social contract between individual and state. Thats where the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) comes in. The VDPS was established in 1979 in the wake of a scare over the safety of the whooping cough vaccine in use at the time. The government-backed scheme offers a one-off financial payment of 120,000 in the event that, on the balance of prob...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d5d6nng67o,2025-03-08
How will weight-loss drugs change our relationship with food?,"We are now in the era of weight-loss drugs. Decisions on how these drugs will be used look likely to shape our future health and even what our society might look like. And, as researchers are finding, they are already toppling the belief that obesity is simply a moral failing of the weak-willed. Weight-loss drugs are already at the heart of the national debate. This week, the new Labour government suggested they could be a tool to help obese people in England off benefits and back into work. That announcement - and the reaction to it - has held a mirror up to our own personal opinions around obesity and what should be done to tackle it. Here are some questions Id like you to ponder. Is obesity something that people bring on themselves and they just need to make better life choices? Or is it a societal failing with millions of victims that needs stronger laws to control the types of food we eat? Are effective weight-loss drugs the sensible choice in an obesity crisis? Are they being used as a convenient excuse to duck the big issue of why so many people are overweight in the first place? Personal choice v nanny state; realism v idealism  there are few medical conditions that stir up such heated debate. I cant resolve all those questions for you - it all depends on your personal views about obesity and the type of country you want to live in. But as you think them over, there are some further things to consider. Obesity is very visible, unlike conditions such as high blood pressure, and has long come with a stigma of blame and shame. Gluttony is one of Christianitys seven deadly sins. Now, lets look at Semaglutide, which is sold under the brand name Wegovy for weight loss. It mimics a hormone that is released when we eat and tricks the brain into thinking we are full, dialling down our appetite so that we eat less. What this means is that by changing only one hormone, suddenly you change your entire relationship with food, says Prof Giles Yeo, an obesity scientist at the University of Cambridge. And that has all sorts of implications for the way we think about obesity. It also means for a lot of overweight people there is a hormonal deficiency, or at least it doesnt go up as high, argues Prof Yeo, which leaves them biologically more hungry and primed to put on weight than someone who is naturally thin. That was likely an advantage 100 or more years ago when food was less plentiful  driving people to consume calories when they are available, because tomorrow there may be none. Our genes have not profoundly changed in a century, but the world we live in has made it easier to pile on the pounds with the rise of cheap and calorie-dense foods, ballooning portion sizes and towns and cities that make it easier to drive than walk or cycle. These changes took off in the second half of the 20th Century, giving rise to what scientists call the obesogenic environment - that is, one that encourages people to eat unhealthily and not do enough exercise.

"NHS needs better plan around weight loss jabs, warn experts","An urgent review is needed to make sure people in England can get weight loss jabs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro on the NHS, top experts warn. It comes a day after the prime minister said such injections could boost Britains economy by getting obese unemployed people back into work. More than 200 doctors and specialists have now written to the health secretary to say how stretched NHS obesity treatment services face unprecedented demand from patients wanting these drugs. They warn the injections are only part of what should be a wider package of non-stigmatising care. They say the government must fix some fundamentals issues in NHS obesity services - chronic underfunding, workforce challenges and unequal access to care. The letter to Wes Streeting is being sent by the Obesity Health Alliance (OHA), which represents health charities and medical royal colleges, and has compiled a report. It says some patients can wait up to five years for specialist support, and that some services are so overstretched they have closed their waiting lists entirely. The OHA wants to see equitable access for obesity treatments, including weight loss injections. There have been reports of global stock shortages and, currently in the UK on the NHS, the injections can only be offered through specialist weight-management services. Some patients go private, but many others miss out, warns the OHA. According to the OHA, about four million people in England are eligible for Wegovy, but NHS projections estimate that by 2028, fewer than 50,000 people a year would get the treatment. Katharine Jenner, director of the OHA, said the weight loss jabs were effective, but that was not the whole picture. Even if you are taking the jabs you still need to have extra care and support around it. You still need to be doing exercise and have dietary advice as well and thats not currently there. There is also concern about who is getting access to this drug. We need to make sure that we are prioritising access based on greatest clinical need and not based on any other factors. She added that the OHA had heard about people that had a right to access treatment services due to their excess weight being turned away. Theyre having to seek private treatment and theyre not getting the care and support package that theyd be expecting to get if you had any other sort of condition, she said. We need to have a review of existing NHS services to identify cases of really good best practice and identify those challenges that exist all over the place. The upcoming approval for the NHS to use another injection, called Mounjaro, dubbed by some as the King Kong of weight loss jabs for how well it appears works in trials, is expected to place even more pressure on the system, the report warns. Alfie Slade, government affairs lead at the OHA, said: The new weight loss drugs represent a breakthrough in treatment, giving hope to the millions of people struggling to manage their weight, but they also expose the weak...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y03p4xlx8o,2025-03-08
How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?,"The number of people taking ADHD medication is at a record high  and the NHS is feeling the strain as it tries to diagnose and treat the condition. Since 2015, the number of patients in England prescribed drugs to treat ADHD has nearly trebled, and BBC research suggests that it would take eight years to assess all the adults on waiting lists. Last year, ADHD was the second-most viewed condition on the NHS website. Concern about this rising demand has prompted the NHS in England to set up a taskforce. So whats going on and where will it end? Is ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) becoming more common? Are we just getting better at recognising it? Or is it being over-diagnosed? It turns out its not just you and I who have been taken by surprise  so have the experts. Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, the ADHD champion for the UKs Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: Nobody predicted that the demand would go up so massively over the last 15 years, and especially the last three years. Hes been running adult ADHD clinics since 2007. At the time, he says, there were just a few of them. ADHD is a fairly novel condition  its only 16 years since the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) officially recognised it in adults. When considering whether it might keep increasing, Dr Müller-Sedgwick argues that there are two different concepts to consider: prevalence and incidence. Prevalence is the percentage of people who have ADHD  Dr Müller-Sedgwick predicts that will stay pretty steady at 3 to 4 of adults in the UK. Incidence is the number of new cases  people getting a diagnosis. Thats where were seeing an increase. He explains: What has changed is the number of patients we are diagnosing. Its almost like the more we diagnose, the more word spreads. Prof Emily Simonoff echoes this. She is a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Kings Maudsley Partnership for Children and Young People. She thinks about 5 to 7 of children have ADHD in the UK  and says: Its pretty similar across the world, thats been consistent and it hasnt actually risen. Prof Simonoff agrees that theres been a steep incline in people coming forward for assessment since the pandemic  but says this comes after years of long-term under-recognition. She points to statistics on ADHD drugs. She would expect about 3 to 4 of children in the UK to need ADHD medication, but in reality, only 1 to 2 are actually using it. She thinks this shows that we are still underestimating the scale of the issue. Prof Simonoff explains: I think thats an important starting point for when we say, My goodness, why are we seeing all these children now  are we over-identifying ADHD? We have under-diagnosed or under-recognised ADHD in the UK for many, many years. In other words, we can expect more people to be diagnosed with ADHD now because services are playing catch-up.

The junior doctors' strikes may be over. But is trouble ahead?,"It had been the NHSs longest-running and bitterest pay dispute - responsible for hundreds of thousands of cancelled operations and appointments. And then, suddenly, word came on Monday that the British Medical Association was recommending that its 50,000 junior doctor members accept a fresh offer from the new government. It sounded almost too good to be true. And now some are wondering if it might be. Last Friday, just three days after formal negotiations started at the Department of Healths London headquarters, Health Secretary Wes Streeting laid his cards on the table. It was, he made clear to the British Medical Association delegation, a final offer - a pay rise topping 22 on average over two years in England. The unions team said they wanted to think about it over the weekend. On Sunday, the BMA junior doctor leaders met and decided that, while it fell short of their demand for a 35 pay increase, this was the best deal they could get. Cue much trumpeting from the government - in her appearance at the House of Commons, Chancellor Rachel Reeves paid tribute to work put in by the health secretary. Mr Streeting had met the BMA joint junior doctor leaders Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi several times before the election - asking them in their last meeting on Zoom to call off the strike they were about to hold in the lead-up to polling day. When he was made health secretary, Mr Streeting immediately called the BMA to set up talks. Two meetings were held with Dr Laurenson and Dr Trivedi in a 10-day period following his appointment - before the formal pay talks started. The health secretarys hand was helped by the fact the independent pay review bodys recommendations for the 2024-25 pay rise had just landed on his desk, suggesting a 6 pay rise and 1,000 lump sum be given. This allowed him to make an offer which effectively combined two years of pay rises. He topped up last years pay award - worth nearly 9 on average - with an extra 4 as well as agreeing to the pay review bodys recommendation for the current financial year. In less than a week of talks, the new health secretary had achieved what the previous government had failed to do over the course of 11 strikes in the previous 18 months. Whats important is it could be presented as a win-win for both sides, one source close to the talks said. The BMA got a big number, while the government only put in an extra 4 above what the pay review body recommended across the two years - that is just one percentage point more than what the Tories put on the table back in December when talks collapsed. Defending the deal, Ms Reeves called the costs - around 350m - a drop in the ocean compared to the 1.7bn cost of NHS strikes. That may all be true, but whats on offer to junior doctors has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the NHS. A pay rise of only 2 for NHS staff was budgeted for in the funding given to the health service this year. The Treasury has indicated it will cover some of the extra, but perhaps no...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19kdyyxzr3o,2025-03-08
Why we might never know the truth about ultra-processed foods,"They are the bête noire of many nutritionists - mass-produced yet moreish foods like chicken nuggets, packaged snacks, fizzy drinks, ice cream or even sliced brown bread. So-called ultra-processed foods (UPF) account for 56 of calories consumed across the UK, and that figure is higher for children and people who live in poorer areas. UPFs are defined by how many industrial processes they have been through and the number of ingredients - often unpronounceable - on their packaging. Most are high in fat, sugar or salt; many youd call fast food. What unites them is their synthetic look and taste, which has made them a target for some clean-living advocates. There is a growing body of evidence that these foods arent good for us. But experts cant agree how exactly they affect us or why, and its not clear that science is going to give us an answer any time soon. While recent research shows many pervasive health problems, including cancers, heart disease, obesity and depression are linked to UPFs, theres no proof, as yet, that they are caused by them. For example, a recent meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago was presented with an observational study of more than 500,000 people in the US. It found that those who ate the most UPFs had a roughly 10 greater chance of dying early, even accounting for their body-mass index and overall quality of diet. In recent years, lots of other observational studies have shown a similar link - but thats not the same as proving that how food is processed causes health problems, or pinning down which aspect of those processes might be to blame. So how could we get to the truth about ultra-processed food? The kind of study needed to prove definitively that UPFs cause health problems would be extremely complex, suggests Dr Nerys Astbury, a senior researcher in diet and obesity at Oxford University. It would need to compare a large number of people on two diets  one high in UPFs and one low in UPFs, but matched exactly for calorie and macronutrient content. This would be fiendishly difficult to actually do. Participants would need to be kept under lock and key so their food intake could be tightly managed. The study would also need to enrol people with similar diets as a starting point. It would be extremely challenging logistically. And to counter the possibility that people who eat fewer UPFs might just have healthier lifestyles such as through taking more exercise or getting more sleep, the participants of the groups would need to have very similar habits. It would be expensive research, but you could see changes from the diets relatively quickly, Dr Astbury says. Funding for this type of research could also be hard to come by. There might be accusations of conflicts of interest, since researchers motivated to run these kind of trials may have an idea of what they want the conclusions to be before they started. These trials couldnt last for very long, anyway - too many participants would most likely drop...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3pppw1z7o,2025-03-08
Are weight-loss injections the answer to obesity?,"Semaglutide is sold as Ozempic for use in diabetes and as Wegovy in weight-loss. You cannot escape the hype around weight-loss injections. Social media is full of before-and-after pictures. They are the source of wild gossip about Hollywood stars, and now the UKs National Health Service is going to pay for them. You can understand the appeal. Excess weight affects our health and leads to stigma - and the mantra of diet and exercise has simply failed for most people. But should we be calling semaglutide, the drug in question, a miracle or skinny jab when some doctors think it is as controversial as treatments get? Does the hype match the reality? Or are we failing to tackle the causes of obesity and just consigning people to a lifetime of medication? Jan, from Kent, was one of the first people in the world to take part in the trials of semaglutide. It is sold as Wegovy for weight-loss and as Ozempic for diabetes, although some people have been buying this version to lose weight. We all know somebody like Jan, who has tried every diet, and she has been battling her waistline her whole life. Semaglutide mimics a hormone that is released when we eat. It tricks the brain into thinking we are full and dials down appetite so we eat less. Once Jan started having the injections, her relationship with food was so transformational that she told me it was either down to the drug or Ive been abducted by aliens. For the first time she could go into a cafe, see some millionaires shortbread and not have her body screaming, I need one. Instead it was, I dont feel hungry... my body was saying you dont want it, it wasnt me using willpower, she says. The results of semaglutide are undeniable - at least for a while. On average, people who were obese lost about 15 of their body weight, external when taking semaglutide alongside healthy lifestyle advice in a trial. Note this is not a skinny jab - 15 takes you from 20 stone down to 17. That study showed the weight came off over the first year and then stabilised for the remaining three months of the trial. We do not know what happens when people take the drug for years. Jan lost 28kg (more than four stone). It meant she could finally enjoy her 60th birthday present - a flight in a Tiger Moth aeroplane, having been over the maximum weight limit before. I was flying in more ways than one, and boy did I enjoy it. Jan after a flight at Duxford Aerodrome in September 2019, which she says would have been impossible before her four-stone weight loss while taking semaglutide The results seem more compelling than your typical diet, which often starts well but then your depleted fat stores signal to the brain to seek food. That is why diets ultimately fail.

What is assisted dying and how could the law change?,"Labour MP Kim Leadbeater says her bill includes the strictest safeguards anywhere in the world MPs voted in support of a proposal to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, in November 2024. Months of detailed scrutiny and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could become law. At present, laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, external was introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their life. It says that anyone who wants to end their life must: be over 18 and live in England and Wales, and have been registered with a GP for at least 12 months have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure be expected to die within six months make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed, about their wish to die satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible - with at least seven days between each assessment Once a patients application has been approved, they would then have to wait 14 days before proceeding. A doctor would prepare the substance being used to end the patients life, but the person would take it themselves. The bill defines the coordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with training, qualifications and experience at a level to be specified by the Health Secretary. It does not say which drug would be used. It would be illegal to use dishonesty, pressure, or to coerce someone into declaring they want to end their life, with a possible 14-year prison sentence. Under the original proposals, a High Court judge would have to approve each request to end a life. However, Leadbetter has suggested a panel of legal and medical experts should oversee applications instead. The panel would be chosen by a new Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission which would be led by a High Court judge or senior former judge. The proposal follows concerns that the High Court would not have capacity to rule on each individual case. However, some opponents have said the move undermines the bills safeguards. The change would need to be approved by the MPs scrutinising the bill. Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says Many months of activity lie ahead in the Commons and the Lords. There are 23 MPs on the committee reviewing the legislation line-by-line. They include 14 supporters - including two ministers - and nine opponents. The committee is holding public hearings and taking evidence from experts. It will then propose amendments to the bill. It is hoped that the committee process will be finished in time for the bill to return to the House of Commons on 25 April. At that stage, all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on the changes proposed by the committee. There would then be more scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords, and further voting. ...",Health,feeds.bbci.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47158287,2025-03-08

C.D.C. Will Investigate Debunked Link Between Vaccines and Autism,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to conduct a large-scale study to re-examine whether there is a connection between vaccines and autism, federal officials said Friday. Dozens of scientific studies have failed to find evidence of a link. But the C.D.C. now falls under the purview of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long expressed skepticism about the safety of vaccines and has vowed to revisit the data. As President Trump said in his Joint Address to Congress, the rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. C.D.C. will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening, Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement Friday. Mr. Nixon did not offer details about the scope or methods of the project. News of the study was first reported Friday morning by Reuters. In pursuing the study, the C.D.C. is defying the wishes of the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy, who said this week that further research into any supposed link between vaccines and autism would be a waste of money and a distraction from research that might shed light on the true reason for a rise in autism rates. Its been exhaustively studied, Mr. Cassidy, a doctor, said during the confirmation hearing for Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, President Trumps nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health.

How Foreign Aid Cuts Are Setting the Stage for Disease Outbreaks,"Dangerous pathogens left unsecured at labs across Africa. Halted inspections for mpox, Ebola and other infections at airports and other checkpoints. Millions of unscreened animals shipped across borders. The Trump administrations pause on foreign aid has hobbled programs that prevent and snuff out outbreaks around the world, scientists say, leaving people everywhere more vulnerable to dangerous pathogens. That includes Americans. Outbreaks that begin overseas can travel quickly: The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, for example, but it soon appeared everywhere, including the United States. When polio or dengue appears in this country, cases are usually linked to international travel. Its actually in the interest of American people to keep diseases down, said Dr. Githinji Gitahi, who heads Amref Health Africa, a large nonprofit that relies on the United States for about 25 percent of its funding. Diseases make their way to the U.S. even when we have our best people on it, and now we are not putting our best people on it, he added.

"What Is Hantavirus, the Rare Disease That Killed Betsy Arakawa?","Betsy Arakawa, the wife of Gene Hackman, died from the effects of hantavirus, a rare disease often caused by contact with droppings from infected rodents. Hantavirus does not spread among people in the cases found in the United States. It can be transmitted through rodent saliva. But it is most commonly transmitted by breathing in particles of dried deer mouse droppings or urine. At first, hantavirus causes flulike symptoms, including fever, chills, body aches and headaches. But as the disease progresses, respiratory symptoms develop and patients can experience shortness of breath and then lung or heart failure. Here is what to know about hantavirus. Hantavirus refers to a family of viruses that are carried by rodents. It is often transmitted to humans by inhaling particles from dried mouse droppings. In North America, Sin Nombre virus is the most common form of this virus, said Sabra L. Klein, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. As of the end of 2022, 864 cases of hantavirus disease had been reported in the United States since surveys of such cases began in 1993, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The classic case of hantavirus is contracted by someone who has visited a rural cabin that has a rodent infestation, said Emily Abdoler, a doctor and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. Hantavirus can cause flulike symptoms that appear one to eight weeks after exposure to droppings from an infected rodent, according to Dr. Heather Jarrell, New Mexicos chief medical examiner. Later, patients often experience shortness of breath and then lung or heart failure. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Trump Administration Sends Politically Charged Survey to Researchers,"The Trump administration has asked researchers and organizations whose work is conducted overseas to disclose ties to those regarded as hostile, including entities associated with communist, socialist or totalitarian parties, according to a questionnaire obtained by The New York Times. The online survey was sent this week to groups working abroad to research diseases like H.I.V., gather surveillance data and strengthen public health systems. Recipients received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Agency for International Development and other federal sources. The questionnaire appears to be very similar to one sent earlier this week to partners of the United States Agency for International Development, which has been all but dismantled by the Trump administration. Both were titled Foreign Assistance Review. Recipients were instructed to respond within 48 hours. Some grantees interviewed by The Times feared that impolitic or unsatisfactory answers could lead to cancellation of funding. Taxpayer dollars must not fund dependency, socialism, corrupt regimes that oppose free enterprise, or intervene in internal matters of another sovereign nation, the questionnaire said.

"As Measles Continues to Spread in Texas, Cases Jump in New Mexico","A raging measles outbreak in West Texas, which has so far killed one child, has not abated and may have taken root in New Mexico, state health officials reported on Friday. The outbreak has sickened nearly 200 people  roughly 40 more cases than were reported on Tuesday  and has left 23 hospitalized in West Texas. Local health officials say even that number may be an undercount. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health and human services secretary, has faced criticism for his handling of the worsening outbreak. A prominent vaccine skeptic, Mr. Kennedy has offered muted support for vaccination and has emphasized untested treatments for measles, like cod liver oil. The outbreak has largely spread within a community of Mennonites in Gaines County, Texas, who historically have had lower vaccination rates and often avoid interacting with the health care system. Last year, roughly 82 percent of the countys kindergarten population had received the measles vaccine. Experts say that vaccination rates must reach at least 95 percent to stave off outbreaks in a community. In a news release on Friday, Texas health officials wrote that more cases are likely to occur, because of the contagiousness of the virus. Health officials in Lea County, N.M.  which borders Gaines County  reported 30 measles cases on Friday, a substantial jump from the nine cases reported on Tuesday. While the cases in New Mexico have not officially been connected to the Texas outbreak, officials have said a link is suspected. On Thursday, state officials said an unvaccinated person who died in Lea County tested positive for the virus, though they have not yet confirmed that measles was the cause of death. Most of these cases along the New Mexico-Texas border have involved someone unvaccinated or with unknown vaccine status. Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prevent more than 97 percent of measles infections. Just 93 percent of kindergarten students nationwide had received the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella in the 2023-24 school year, down from 95 percent before the pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While symptoms typically resolve in a few weeks, measles can be extremely dangerous in rare cases. It may cause pneumonia, making it difficult for patients, especially children, to get oxygen into their lungs. The infection can also lead to brain swelling, which can cause lasting damage, including blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities. For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the C.D.C. The virus also causes immune amnesia, making the body unable to defend itself against illnesses it has already been exposed to and leaving patients more susceptible to future infections. A 2015 study found that before the M.M.R. vaccine was widely available, measles might have been responsible for up to half of all infectious disease deaths in children.",Health,rss.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/health/measles-texas-new-mexico.html,2025-03-08
"Republican Voters Support Medicaid but Want Work Requirements, Poll Finds","As Congressional Republicans weigh major cuts to Medicaid, most voters do not want to see the public health plans funding dialed back, according to a poll released Friday by KFF, a nonpartisan health research firm. Just 17 percent of respondents said they supported cuts to Medicaid, the government health insurance program that covers more than 70 million people. Forty percent said they wanted to keep spending unchanged, and 42 percent said they would like it increased. But at the same time, the poll found significant support for certain policies that would limit the program, such as requiring enrollees to work. More than 60 percent of voters  and 47 percent of Democrats  supported a work requirement, the poll found. That change, which has been championed by some congressional Republicans, is estimated to cut about 100 billion from Medicaid, as those who were unemployed  or could not file the paperwork showing they had a job  would no longer be covered. The programs cost was 584 billion in 2024, or about 8 percent of total federal spending. As Republicans weigh deep cuts, these congressional districts  some red, some blue  have the most to lose. The poll also illustrated Medicaids wide reach, with just over half of respondents saying that either they or a family member had at one point had Medicaid coverage. There was nearly universal agreement that Medicaid mattered to voters local communities, with 98 percent of Democrats and 94 percent of Republicans saying they thought it was somewhat or very important.

"As Ebola Spreads in Uganda, Trump Aid Freeze Hinders Effort to Contain It, U.S. Officials Fear","The Ebola outbreak in Uganda has worsened significantly, and the countrys ability to contain the spread has been severely weakened by the Trump administrations freeze on foreign assistance, American officials said this week. The officials, representing a variety of health and security agencies, made the assessment during a meeting with U.S. Embassy staff in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, on Wednesday. An audio recording of the session was obtained by The New York Times. There have been two more deaths, the mother and newborn sibling of a 4-year-old who died last week, an American official said. The mother and sibling died earlier than the 4-year-old, but were not identified as probable Ebola cases until after they were buried through belated contact tracing. Eighty-two people have so far been identified as close contacts of the mother and her two children, at high risk for infection, and 68 of them are now in quarantine while the others are still being traced. The officials said public health workers ability to trace their contacts and conduct surveillance for new cases is severely hindered without U.S. assistance. Two of the contacts are already symptomatic and have been admitted to an isolation hospital ward, an American official in Uganda said in the meeting. The 4-year-old was taken for treatment at four different health facilities before being diagnosed with Ebola, meaning that many of those who have potentially been exposed to the virus are health care workers. During the meeting Wednesday, American officials said that the Ugandan government also lacked sufficient laboratory supplies, diagnostic equipment and protective gear for medical workers and people tracing contacts. The termination of grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development was impeding the ability to procure those supplies, one official said. The meeting, conducted by video, was attended by representatives from the State Department, U.S.A.I.D., the Defense Department, the U.S. Embassy in Uganda and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Senators Press Marty Makary on Abortion Pills and Vaccines,"At a confirmation hearing for Dr. Marty Makary on Thursday, senators focused heavily on the safety of the abortion pill, with Republican lawmakers urging him to restrict access and Democratic lawmakers demanding that he maintain its current availability. Dr. Makary, President Trumps nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, signaled that he shared Republicans concerns about the current policy, issued during the Biden administration, which expanded access by allowing people to obtain the pills without an in-person medical appointment. Several Democrats pointed to volumes of studies showing that the drugs are safe. Dr. Makary told members of the Senate health committee, which held the hearing, that he would review the pills safety and the policy at issue. He said he would take a solid, hard look at the data and to meet with the professional career scientists who have reviewed the data at the F.D.A. and to build an expert coalition to review the ongoing data, which is required to be collected. The hearing also touched on vaccines, with several lawmakers, including the committee chairman, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, questioning why an advisory committee meeting on next years flu vaccine had been canceled in recent weeks and asking whether it would be held later. He and others stressed that the flu panel met annually, and some reminded Dr. Makary that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees the F.D.A. as health secretary, had pledged transparency in agency decision-making. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, called the cancellation unprecedented and dangerous after decades of annual meetings. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Aging Women’s Brain Mysteries Are Tested in Trio of Studies,"Womens brains are superior to mens in at least in one respect  they age more slowly. And now, a group of researchers reports that they have found a gene in mice that rejuvenates female brains. Humans have the same gene. The discovery suggests a possible way to help both women and men avoid cognitive declines in advanced age. The study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. The journal also published two other studies on womens brains, one on the effect of hormone therapy on the brain and another on how age at the onset of menopause shapes the risk of getting Alzheimers disease. The evidence that womens brains age more slowly than mens seemed compelling. Researchers, looking at the way the brain uses blood sugar, had already found that the brains of aging women are years younger, in metabolic terms, than the brains of aging men. Other scientists, examining markings on DNA, found that female brains are a year or so younger than male brains. And careful cognitive studies of healthy older people found that women had better memories and cognitive function than men of the same age. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Melody Beattie, Author of a Self-Help Best Seller, Dies at 76","Melody Beattie, whose experiences as a drug addict, a chemical dependency counselor and the wife of an alcoholic informed a best-selling book about codependence that has guided countless people to shed toxic relationships, died on Feb. 27 in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. She was 76. Her daughter, Nichole Beattie, said the cause was heart failure. She had been hospitalized from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, then evacuated from her home in Malibu because of a wildfire and moved into her daughters home, where she died. By popularizing the concept of codependence, Ms. Beattie (pronounced BEE-tee) became a literary star in the self-help world with Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Star Caring for Yourself (1986), which has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. You could call her the mother of the self-help genre, said Nicole Dewey, the publishing director of Spiegel  Grau, which has sold more than 400,000 copies of the book since taking over publication in 2022. Trysh Travis, the author of The Language of the Heart: A Cultural History of the Recovery Movement From Alcoholics Anonymous to Oprah Winfrey (2009), said in an interview that Codependent No More has succeeded because of Ms. Beatties common-sense approach and vernacular charm. She added: There had been other books and pamphlets published in the recovery space in the early 1980s. Melody made the same arguments, but her voice came across very clearly. It wasnt clinical  and she had a set of ideas that could be applied to many if not all the problems one was having  and it hit the market at the right time.

Unvaccinated New Mexico Resident Dies of Suspected Measles,"An unvaccinated person who died in New Mexico has tested positive for measles, state health officials said on Thursday, possibly the second such fatality in a growing outbreak that began in West Texas. The officials have not yet confirmed that measles was the cause of death, and said the person did not seek medical treatment before dying. The announcement came a little over a week after a child died of measles in Gaines County, Texas, the first such death in the United States in 10 years. Ten cases of measles, six adults and four children, have been reported in Lea County, N.M., which borders Gaines County, the epicenter of the West Texas outbreak. This outbreak has been a trial by fire of the new secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. His equivocal response has drawn harsh criticism from scientists, who say he has offered muted support for vaccination and has emphasized untested treatments for measles like cod liver oil. Instead of broadly lauding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, as past H.H.S. secretaries did, Mr. Kennedy has said that vaccines help protect against measles but that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.

"Defunded Aid Programs Are Asked by Trump Administration to Prove Their Value, on a Scale of 1 to 5","Last week, the Trump administration terminated nearly all of the United States foreign aid contracts after telling a federal court that its review of aid programs had concluded, and it had shut down those found not to be in the national interest. But over the last few days, many of those same programs have received a questionnaire asking them for the first time to detail what their projects do (or did) and how that work aligns with national interests. The survey, obtained by The New York Times, is titled Foreign Assistance Review. Some agencies received it with instructions stating that data collected will support the next stage of the administrations foreign assistance review. The deadlines given for returning the surveys range from March 7 to March 17. Many of the projects under scrutiny have already fired their staff and closed their doors, because they have received no federal funds since the review process ostensibly began. President Trump issued an executive order freezing aid on Jan. 20, pending a review. Within some organizations, there are no staff members left to complete the survey. The distribution of the survey is the latest twist in an eight-week-long roller coaster ride for aid organizations. The chaos began with a stop-work order for employees and contractors of the United States Agency for International Development and a freezing of all funds, including reimbursements for hundreds of millions of dollars already spent. That was followed by a process allowing organizations that provided lifesaving medical treatment and food aid to seek a waiver allowing them to continue their work. Then came terminations, last Wednesday, of more than 5,000 projects and programs. Since then, some projects have been told they were fully restored, and others that they are restored only to the terms of their original waiver, which runs out next month. Almost none have seen any of the funds they are owed unfrozen. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

FDA Nominee Marty Makary to Face Grilling Over Cutbacks and Policy Shifts,"Dr. Marty Makary may face sharp questions from senators about whether he will defend the Food and Drug Administration against staff cutbacks and industry pressure on Thursday, although he is still expected to sail through his confirmation hearing to become the agencys commissioner. Dr. Makary built his reputation as a contrarian in the medical field, gaining widespread notice by speaking out about medical errors. Those close to him have remarked on his willingness to agree with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nations health secretary, on a variety of issues. As a pancreatic cancer surgeon and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Makary has been viewed by some as a study in contrasts. He has written several books criticizing what he considers flaws in medical orthodoxy that result in recommendations backed by scant evidence. Yet he also drew attention from the Trump team as a Fox News personality with more controversial views, like his relatively early predictions that Covid would fade as a concern and that widespread immunity would take hold long before it did. Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine, said that it was not clear which was the true Marty Makary. She said that was an important question, given some of Mr. Kennedys pronouncements. The health secretary has suggested that the F.D.A. should lift constraints on risky products like raw milk, which can be rife with bacteria, and had embraced hydroxychloroquine, a drug briefly used as a Covid therapy before its risks were deemed to exceed any benefit.

"Clearing the Way for Bicyclists, for a Healthier Planet","This article is part of a Women and Leadership special report highlighting women who are charting new pathways and fighting for opportunities for women and others. Jill Warren was in corporate law firms for 20 years, doing business development and working as chief marketing officer. But in her private life, cycling was her absolute passion. I cycled for daily mobility, she said in a phone interview, and a holiday wasnt complete without taking a bike along. Like many people, she had cycled as a child. But when she got her drivers license at age 16, like most teenagers in American towns like Cary, Ill., the Chicago suburb where she grew up, the car was her main means of transport. That changed when she was studying abroad in Freiburg, Germany, where absolutely everybody cycled. There, she said, I rediscovered cycling. Now 56, she is the chief executive of the European Cyclists Federation (E.C.F.), a Brussels-based nongovernmental organization that advocates cycling as a sustainable and healthy form of transport and leisure. The conversation has been edited and condensed. Why is the federations work necessary? Its a chance to make a big difference to peoples health, the environment and the livability of cities. Transport is responsible for about 27 percent of global carbon emissions. Road vehicles account for about three quarters of transport CO2 emissions, and this isnt decreasing. A recent study found that people who cycle daily have 84 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions than noncyclists. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Digging Out of a Therapy Rut,"Therapy has been a part of Katerina Kellys weekly routine since elementary school, when a teacher suggested counseling for the 8-year-old. At the time, Katerinas autism was affecting their ability to manage time, make decisions and socialize. And for many years, the therapist seemed helpful. But once college rolled around, things changed. I always left counseling feeling either worse than I started  or numb, said Mx. Kelly, 29, who lives in Natick, Mass, and uses theythem pronouns. The skills that Mx. Kellys therapist had taught them in childhood werent translating as well now that they were older. In other words, they had hit a rut  the therapy, and the therapist, were not producing the desired results. A therapy rut can feel disheartening, but it doesnt have to end your pursuit of better mental health. We asked psychologists how to identify whether youve reached a sticking point and what to do about it. If youve hit a rut, you may feel as if your therapy sessions have stalled or become unhelpful, said Jameca Woody Cooper, president of the Missouri Psychological Association.

A Skeptical G.O.P. Senator Makes His Peace With Kennedy,"Perhaps no vote was as agonizing for Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican and medical doctor, than his vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Trumps health secretary. Mr. Cassidy wondered aloud for days how Mr. Kennedy, the nations most vocal and powerful critic of vaccinations, might handle an infectious disease crisis. Now, as a measles outbreak rages in West Texas, Mr. Cassidy has found out. It all comes down, he said, to the gestalt. On Monday, days after the Texas outbreak killed an unvaccinated child, Mr. Cassidy, the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, was clipping down a Capitol corridor when he was asked about Mr. Kennedy. He pointed to a Fox News Digital opinion piece in which Mr. Kennedy advised parents to consult their doctors about vaccination, while calling it a personal decision. That Fox editorial was very much encouraging people to get vaccinated, he said. Reminded that Mr. Kennedy had described it as a personal choice, Mr. Cassidy thought for a moment. If you want to like, parse it down to the line, you can say, Discuss with your doctor, Mr. Cassidy said. He also said, Were making vaccinations available. Were doing this for vaccination. Were doing that for vaccination. So if you take the gestalt of it, the gestalt was, Lets get vaccinated! Mr. Cassidys assessment  that the whole of Mr. Kennedys message was more than the sum of its parts  reflects how the measles outbreak has put a spotlight on how Mr. Trumps unorthodox choice to run the countrys top health agency has brought a once-fringe perspective into the political mainstream, creating discomfort for some Republicans. As the founder and chairman of his nonprofit, Childrens Health Defense, and later as a presidential candidate, Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly downplayed the benefits of vaccination. He has also repeatedly suggested that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism, despite extensive research that has found no link. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Weight Loss Drug Will Be Offered for $499 a Month for Some Patients,"Novo Nordisk will cut the price of its blockbuster weight loss medication Wegovy to 499 per month for certain patients who pay using their own money instead of going through insurance, the drug maker said on Wednesday. The move could cause more patients to start taking the drug. But the impact stands to be limited, because the decision does not lower prices for patients who get their health insurance through government programs or for employers that are struggling with the huge costs of medications like Wegovy, which have revolutionized the treatment of obesity. To be eligible for the reduced price, patients must be uninsured or commercially insured on plans that dont cover the drug. Previously, the drug maker had offered a coupon to such patients allowing them to get a months supply of the drug for 650; Wednesdays move translates into savings of 150 per month for such patients. The new offering is not available to tens of millions of Americans who get their insurance through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid  a demographic that largely lacks insurance coverage for weight loss drugs like Wegovy. To get Novo Nordisks drug, these patients must generally pay 1,300 or more per month out of pocket at a pharmacy. Novo Nordisk will offer the discounted product through an online pharmacy that will send prescriptions to patients through the mail  a strategy that drug makers are increasingly using to take more control of the distribution of their products. Novo Nordisks competitor, Eli Lilly, has a similar offering for vials of its weight loss drug, Zepbound, for 499 per month or less. Novo Nordisks price reduction comes just weeks before the market for cheaper copycat versions of Wegovy is expected to contract substantially. For the past few years, patients seeking lower prices have turned to versions created through a drug-ingredient mixing process known as compounding, which is permitted by regulators when patented products are in short supply. Patients often pay about 150 per month out of pocket for compounded versions of Wegovy. An estimated two million patients got the drug this way over a recent one-year period. But last month the Food and Drug Administration declared the Wegovy shortage over and ordered compounders to wind down their operations by April or May. Novo Nordisk now has the opportunity to scoop up displaced patients who had been relying on compounding and increase sales of its official version of the drug.",Health,rss.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/health/wegovy-price-weight-loss-drugs.html,2025-03-08
"Women With Postpartum Depression Experienced Brain Changes During Pregnancy, Study Finds","Postpartum depression affects about one in every seven women who give birth, but little is known about what happens in the brains of pregnant women who experience it. A new study begins to shed some light. Researchers scanned the brains of dozens of women in the weeks before and after childbirth and found that two brain areas involved in the processing and control of emotions increased in size in women who developed symptoms of postpartum depression. The results, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, constitute some of the first evidence that postpartum depression is associated with changes in the brain during pregnancy. Researchers found that women with symptoms of depression in the first month after giving birth also had increases in the volume of their amygdala, a brain area that plays a key role in emotional processing. Women who rated their childbirth experience as difficult or stressful  a perception that is often associated with postpartum depression  also showed increases in the volume of the hippocampus, a brain area that helps regulate emotions. This is really the first step in trying to understand how does the brain change in people who have a normal course of pregnancy and then those who experience perinatal depression, and what can we do about it, said Dr. Sheila Shanmugan, an assistant professor of psychiatry, obstetrics-gynecology and radiology at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the study. The big takeaways are about how there are these really profound brain changes during pregnancy and how now were seeing it in depression circuitry specifically, she said.

Florida Seeks Drug Prescription Data With Names of Patients and Doctors,"Floridas insurance regulator has demanded an unusually intrusive trove of data on millions of prescription drugs filled in the state last year, including the names of patients taking the medications, their dates of birth and doctors theyve seen. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in January sought this information from pharmacy benefit managers like UnitedHealths Optum Rx and CVS Healths Caremark, companies that oversee prescription drugs for employers and government programs. It remained unclear why the state was ordering the submission of so much data. In a letter to one benefit manager reviewed by The New York Times, the regulator said the state required the data to review whether the benefit managers, known as P.B.M.s, were compliant with a 2023 state law aimed at lowering drug prices and reining in the managers. But the demand is sparking concerns about government overreach and patient privacy. You dont need such granular patient information for purposes of oversight, said Sharona Hoffman, a health law and privacy expert at Case Western Reserve University. She added: You have to worry: Is the government actually trying to get information about reproductive care or transgender care or mental health care? Floridas six-week abortion ban, enacted by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, and the states Republican-dominated legislature, requires that doctors who prescribe abortion pills dispense them in person, not through the mail. Another Florida law banned transgender transition care for minors and made it harder for adults to seek such care. Last year, a judge struck down key parts of that law, though it is still being enforced while the legal fight makes its way through the courts. The data requested by the state could, in theory, be used to determine whether physicians are complying with those laws. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Guarded N.I.H. Nominee Faces Sharp Questions on Vaccines and Research Cuts,"Under hostile questioning from senators of both parties, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, President Trumps nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health, said on Wednesday that he was convinced vaccines did not cause autism even as he urged more research on the question, which scientists say has long been settled. The hearing became a battlefield for the Trump administrations early actions on health, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s reluctance to explicitly recommend vaccinations in the midst of a deadly measles outbreak in West Texas. I fully support children being vaccinated for diseases like measles, Dr. Bhattacharya, a health economist and professor of medicine at Stanford University, told the Senate Health Committee. But to assuage skeptical parents, he also said scientists should conduct more research on autism and vaccines  a position that senators from both parties noted was at odds with extensive evidence showing no association between them. If confirmed, Dr. Bhattacharya would lead the worlds largest funder of biomedical research, a sprawling agency with a 48 billion budget and 27 separate institutes and centers that has long been praised by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Recently, though, the N.I.H. has been rocked by Trump administration moves that blocked key parts of its grant-making apparatus and resulted in the firing of roughly 1,200 employees. Together with other lapses and proposed changes in N.I.H. funding, the administrations actions have rattled the biomedical research industry, which is responsible for driving pharmaceutical advancements and generating tens of billions of dollars in economic activity each year. Hours before Wednesdays hearing, the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting group led by Elon Musk, trumpeted the cancellation of N.I.H. grants.

U.S. Embassies Halt Air Quality Monitoring Abroad,"Whats the air quality in New Delhi, Jakarta or Buenos Aires? Until Tuesday, the United States Embassy in those cities could have told you. But the Trump administration has effectively shut down a global air quality monitoring program, ending more than a decade of public data-collection and reporting from 80 embassies and consulates worldwide. The information has supported research, helped thousands of foreign service officers working abroad to decide if it was safe to let their children play outdoors, and has directly led to air quality improvements in countries like China. The State Department said in an email that the program was being suspended due to budget constraints. Health officials and environmental experts said ending air quality monitoring would hurt Americans overseas, particularly those who work for the U. S. government. Embassies are situated sometimes in very difficult air quality circumstances, said Gina McCarthy, who led the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration.

"As Measles Spreads, Kennedy Embraces Remedies Like Cod Liver Oil","As a measles outbreak expands in West Texas, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health and human services secretary, on Tuesday cheered several unconventional treatments, including cod liver oil, but again did not urge all Americans to get vaccinated. In a prerecorded interview that aired Tuesday morning on Fox News, Mr. Kennedy said that the federal government was shipping doses of vitamin A to Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, and helping to arrange ambulance rides. In a fuller version of the interview posted online that night, Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that vaccines do prevent infection and recommended that unvaccinated residents of the county get the shots, but cast it as a personal decision. Texas doctors had seen very, very good results, Mr. Kennedy claimed, by treating measles cases with a steroid, budesonide; an antibiotic called clarithromycin; and cod liver oil, which he said had high levels of vitamin A and vitamin D. While physicians sometimes administer doses of vitamin A to treat children with severe measles cases, cod liver oil is by no means an evidence-based treatment, said Dr. Sean OLeary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. Dr. OLeary added that he had never heard of a physician using the supplement against measles. In comments that seemed to refer to conventional measures against measles, Mr. Kennedy said, Were going to be honest with the American people for the first time in history about what actually  about all of the tests and all of the studies, about what we know, what we dont know.

He Fought Claims of Harm From Infant Formula. Now He Regulates It.,"The new head of the Food and Drug Administration division that regulates infant formula was in recent months a corporate lawyer defending a top formula maker from claims that its product gave rise to debilitating harm to premature babies. Kyle A. Diamantas joined the F.D.A. last month to lead the food division, leaving the law firm Jones Day, which has served as a pipeline of talent to both Trump administrations. As a partner in Jones Days Miami office, Mr. Diamantass recent work included defending Abbott Laboratories in a lawsuit accusing the company of failing to adequately warn parents that its specialized formula for premature infants was associated with an elevated risk of a deadly bowel condition. Abbott lost the case and was ordered to pay 495 million. Abbott is appealing the verdict. Mr. Diamantass role in that case and other Abbott cases has not been previously reported. The leader of the F.D.A.s food division has a wide-ranging role in ensuring the safety of about 80 percent of the food supply in the United States. In that job, Mr. Diamantas is also expected to take a lead role in enacting Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s agenda, which calls for reducing additives in food and eliminating what Mr. Kennedy has described as corruption in public health agencies. We will shut the revolving door to re-establish public trust, Mr. Kennedy told the Health and Human Services Departments staff during his first week in office.

"Where Being Gay Is Punishable by Death, Aid Cuts Are ‘Heartbreaking’","In the weeks since President Trump signed an executive order dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, Andrea Minaj Casablancas phone has been inundated with desperate pleas for help. A counselor who works with nonprofits catering to members of Ugandas embattled L.G.B.T.Q. population, she has fielded urgent requests from people seeking H.I.V. medications, therapy sessions and shelter in the wake of Mr. Trumps executive order. Ms. Casablanca responded to these calls while grappling with her own crisis: being fired from a job that was funded by U.S.A.I.D. Our whole world has been turned upside down, Ms. Casablanca, a 25-year-old transgender woman, said on a recent afternoon in Kampala, the capital. Everyone is in fear of the future. L.G.B.T.Q. people in Uganda have in recent years endured an intensifying crackdown in this conservative East African nation. President Yoweri Museveni signed a law in 2023 that calls for life imprisonment for anyone who engages in same-sex relations in Uganda and up to a decade in prison for anyone who tries to. Now, activists say, the U.S.A.I.D. cuts have put them at even greater risk, with shelters underfunded, hundreds of individuals unemployed and many more facing discrimination and violence. Vital medical supplies remain scarce, while members of L.G.B.T.Q. groups increasingly report feeling depressed or suicidal. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Memos Detail Human Costs of Cuts to Foreign Aid,"The Trump administrations decision to withdraw foreign aid and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development is likely to cause enormous human suffering, according to estimates by the agency itself. Among them: up to 18 million additional cases of malaria per year, and as many as 166,000 additional deaths; 200,000 children paralyzed with polio annually, and hundreds of millions of infections; one million children not treated for severe acute malnutrition, which is often fatal, each year; more than 28,000 new cases of such infectious diseases as Ebola and Marburg every year. Those stark projections were laid out in a series of memos by Nicholas Enrich, acting assistant administrator for global health at U.S.A.I.D., which were obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Enrich was placed on administrative leave on Sunday. Nicholas Enrich, acting assistant administrator for global health at U.S.A.I.D., spelled out projections for human health following cuts to foreign aid. Mr. Enrich was placed on administrative leave over the weekend. In one memo, he placed the blame for these potential health crises on political leadership at U.S.A.I.D., the Department of State, and D.O.G.E., who have created and continue to create intentional andor unintentional obstacles that have wholly prevented implementation of aid programs. Those leaders have blocked payment systems, created new and ineffective processes for payments, and constantly shifted guidance regarding which activities qualify as lifesaving, Mr. Enrich wrote. Another memo describes the slashing of the agencys global health work force from 783 on Jan. 20 to fewer than 70 on Sunday. In an interview, Mr. Enrich said he released the memos on Sunday afternoon, after an email arrived placing him on leave, to set the record straight on the gutting of U.S.A.I.D. staff and the termination of thousands of lifesaving grants.

"Federal Officials Underplaying Measles Vaccination, Experts Say","In a first test of the Trump administrations ability to respond to an infectious disease emergency, its top health official has shied away from one of the governments most important tools, experts said on Sunday: loudly and directly encouraging parents to get their children vaccinated. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, was widely criticized as minimizing the measles outbreak in West Texas at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. In a social media post on Friday, he took a new tack, saying that the outbreak was a top priority for his department, Health and Human Services. He noted various ways in which the department is aiding Texas, among them by funding the states immunization program and updating advice that doctors give children vitamin A. But on neither occasion did Mr. Kennedy himself advise Americans to make sure their children got the shots. On Sunday night, he edged closer in an opinion piece for Fox News. Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that vaccines protect individual children from measles and urged parents to talk with their doctors to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one, he added. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of H.H.S., did not send its first substantive notice about the outbreak until Thursday, almost a month after the first cases in Texas were reported.

Vesuvius Turned One Victim’s Brain to Glass,"Five years ago Italian researchers published a study on the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. that detailed how one victim of the blast, a male presumed to be in his mid 20s, had been found nearby in the seaside settlement of Herculaneum. He was lying facedown and buried by ash on a wooden bed in the College of the Augustales, a public building dedicated to the worship of Emperor Augustus. Some scholars believe that the man was the centers caretaker and was asleep at the time of the disaster. In 2018, one researcher discovered black, glossy shards embedded inside the caretakers skull. The paper, published in 2020, speculated that the heat of the explosion was so immense that it had fused the victims brain tissue into glass. Forensic analysis of the obsidian-like chips revealed proteins common in brain tissue and fatty acids found in human hair, while a chunk of charred wood unearthed near the skeleton indicated a thermal reading as high as 968 degrees Fahrenheit, roughly the dome temperature of a wood-fired Neapolitan pizza oven. It was the only known instance of soft tissue  much less any organic material  being naturally preserved as glass. On Thursday, a paper published in Nature verified that the fragments are indeed glassified brain. Using techniques such as electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, scientists examined the physical properties of samples taken from the glassy fragments and demonstrated how they were formed and preserved. The unique finding implies unique processes, said Guido Giordano, a volcanologist at the Roma Tre University and lead author of the new study. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

She’s a Foot Soldier in America’s Losing War With Chronic Disease,"Sam Runyon navigated to the house by memory as she reviewed her patients file, a problem list of medications and chronic diseases that went on for several pages. Sam, a 45-year-old nurse, had already seen Cora Perkins survive two types of cancer. During previous appointments, she had found Coras arms turning blue from diabetes, or her ankles swollen from congestive heart failure, or her stomach cramping from hunger with no fresh food left in the house. It had been a week since Sams last visit, and she wondered if anyone had come or gone through the front door since. She knocked, but nobody answered. She walked across the porch to a hole in the window and called into the house. Cora, honey? Are you OK? A light flickered inside. A dog began to bark. Sam pushed open the door and walked into the living room, where she found Cora wrapped under a blanket. Sam. Thank God youre here, said Cora, 64. She tried to stand, but she lost her balance and sat back down in a recliner. It looks like youre wobbly this morning, Sam said. Are you feeling really bad or just normal bad? It was the same question she asked her patients dozens of times each week as she made home visits across West Virginia, traveling from one impending emergency to the next in a country where feeling bad had become the new normal. All 31 patients in her caseload for the Williamson Health and Wellness Center were under 65 years old, and yet each had at least one of the chronic diseases that had become endemic in the United States over the last two decades: death rates up 25 percent nationally from diabetes, 40 percent from liver disease, 60 percent from kidney disease, 80 percent from hypertension and more than 95 percent from obesity, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mind over body: the trouble with treating chronic conditions | Letters,"Readers respond to an extract from Dr Suzanne OSullivans book on the pathologising of mental health problems and behavioural disorders While I agree with viewing health holistically and treating the person, not the disease, I felt uncomfortable with some of the conclusions that Suzanne OSullivan draws from the cases presented (Are we less healthy than we used to be  or overdiagnosing illness?, 1 March). Implying that we are overdiagnosing certain conditions only reinforces the stigma associated with them, and will prevent people in need from being taken seriously and receiving appropriate support and treatment. The scepticism, however well-meaning, can be damaging for patient outcomes and public health in general. Treatments and support available for conditions such as ADHD and autism are already lacking and underresearched. The rise of diagnostic levels of most of these conditions comes from increased awareness, and also from the environmental changes in our society that place ever-increasing pressure on individuals to perform at a certain standard. Neurodiversity conditions have become a lot more debilitating for those experiencing them. Increased population density exposes individuals to more stimuli than their nervous system can handle. Technological progress, particularly the advent of smartphones, has led to an expectation of being always available and a pressure to react and respond in real time that did not exist 20 years ago. The solutions to the problematic rise of diagnoses, then, must also be societal. Individual adjustments, as seen in the case of Anna in the article, can only help to a degree, and for some it may not be enough to allow them to be fully functioning in society. There needs to be a recognition that some of the narratives shaping our society today are actively preventing a significant part of the population from being able to fully contribute. Placing the onus on the struggling individual is unhelpful.Diana AnisimovaLondon Suzanne OSullivans 2015 book, Its All in Your Head, made a huge impact. We psychotherapists felt this doctor was singing our song  the power of the mind over the body. Her powerful case studies demonstrated the psychological underpinnings of medically unexplained diagnoses. Nine years later, OSullivan writes of the startling rise in the diagnosis of mental health disorders: We are not getting sicker  we are attributing more to sickness. I wonder if we need to think in broader terms about what is needed now for our sickness. If our bodies are screaming in distress, what is not being heard? Psychotherapy offers an environment in which people can and do heal and change. Through understanding and care, our most basic human needs are met. This transformational process is very different from diagnosis. It offers an exploration that tries to understand why we are the way we are, and not rush to conclusions. I can understand why taking the diagnostic route is tempting. But I have always believed that psychoth...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/07/mind-over-body-the-trouble-with-treating-chronic-conditions,2025-03-08
Scorpions by Tuppence Middleton review – living with OCD,"The Downton Abbey actor offers a skilful, poetic and bleakly funny account of coping with a lifelong condition Tuppence Middleton was 11 years old when her parents realised something wasnt right. It was 1998 and they had told their daughter  who was just emerging from a four-month bout of chronic fatigue  that it was time for bed. Half an hour later, her mother went to check on her and found her still dressed and standing in her bedroom doorway. Asked why, her daughter replied: Im doing my routine. Middleton  who would grow up to become an actor known for her performances in Mank and Downton Abbey  had developed obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), a condition that affects 2 of the global population, and left her convinced that if she didnt complete certain rituals, something terrible would happen: her parents would die, the house would burn down or she would vomit (one of her greatest fears). Her compulsions entailed silently tapping and counting to eight at specific points around the house: doorknobs, doorframes, the corners of rooms, the edges of mirrors. In Scorpions, Middleton lays out what it is like to live with OCD, skilfully and often poetically articulating the mental distress that comes with the condition. The scorpions of the title are how she characterises the illness, creatures that wield their own special power over my brain, shaping the architecture and rhythm of my thoughts  Small armoured bodies scuttle along an intricate web of neural pathways, disturbing the delicate flow of logical thought. We are not short of books about OCD: Rose Cartwrights Pure, Bryony Gordons Mad Girl and David Adams The Man Who Couldnt Stop. Middletons is a worthy addition to the roll call, throwing more light on the impulses and cycles of thought that many people with OCD strive to keep secret out of fear of judgment. Middleton has had OCD for 30 years and, in that time, public understanding has increased. But with that, she warns, has come a tendency to simplify and trivialise the illness. Years ago, she recalls receiving a coffee mug as a Christmas present with the words OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE emblazoned on it in pink letters. It is hard to imagine a line of gift items with ANOREXIA or PTSD boldly stamped across them for all to see, Middleton writes. So why is OCD continually used as shorthand for lighthearted craziness? There is nothing cute or whimsical about Middletons absolute certainty that she has left her front door open after leaving the house, despite having gone back to check multiple times, or her mortal fear of being around people she suspects  usually on scant evidence  may be coming down with a virus. When this happens, social niceties go out the window, and friendships, particularly new ones, are easily destroyed. Middleton describes a typical conversation between her and the scorpions in the dead of night, a time when her senses are heightened and fears easily stoked. Trust us, we can help you, they say as she becomes convinced she is g...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/08/scorpions-by-tuppence-middleton-review-living-with-ocd,2025-03-08

"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: the infection that killed Betsy Arakawa, Gene Hackman’s wife","Virus that caused death of actors wife in Santa Fe is rare but serious illness that can damage major organs of the body Authorities said on Friday that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease days after his wife, Betsy Arakawa, died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. But what exactly is this rare illness? Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare but serious viral disease that can damage the heart, lungs, and other organs. The syndrome progresses quickly and can be fatal, according to the Cleveland Clinic, one of the largest and most respected medical centers in the US. Hantaviruses cause two syndromes, including HPS and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People can contract HPS by inhaling, eating, drinking, or coming into contact with infected mouse or rat feces, urine, or saliva. Although not all mice and rats carry hantaviruses, some species, including deer mice, white-footed mice, rice rats and cotton rats, are known carriers in North America. Between one and eight weeks after that exposure, someone might begin to feel like they have a flu-like illness, Dr Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, told the Guardian. In the United States, most cases of HPS occur in states west of the Mississippi River. Its mostly in rural areas, because thats where most of the rodents carrying the disease live, Bartolome said. HPS remains rare in the US despite its severe symptoms. Between 1993 and 2022, there were 864 reported US cases. New Mexico had the highest number over that time, at 122, followed by Colorado at 119. Person-to-person transmission is extremely rare and has only been documented in cases of a hantavirus strain found in Argentina and Chile. Once the hantavirus enters the body, it replicates and spreads, which can cause a severe amount of damage in the lungs. The virus weakens blood vessels and causes leakage and fluid buildup in the air sacs, making breathing difficult. In the heart, it damages the heart muscle and weakens blood vessels while reducing the hearts ability to pump oxygen-rich blood to the bodys organs. If untreated, these effects can lead to shock, organ failure, and death. HPS symptoms work in three phases. The first is the incubation phase, lasting up to eight weeks, during which the virus is present in the body but no noticeable symptoms are present. The second phase develops quickly and includes fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, dry cough, headache, and dizziness. This stage lasts between two and eight days. About four to 10 days after these initial symptoms, the third and most severe phase begins. This last phase includes internal bleeding, fluid-filled lungs, difficulty breathing, a rapid heartbeat, and chest tightness. These symptoms can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chanc...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/hantavirus-gene-hackman-wife-death,2025-03-08
Jim Mackey should note that hospital systems are best led by doctors | Letters,"Amanda Goodall says the next boss of NHS England should give more decision-making powers and responsibility to outstanding doctors and clinicians Re your report (Next boss of NHS England prepares purge of senior leadership team, 6 March), I hope that Sir Jim Mackey will consider the body of research showing that the best hospital systems are on average led by doctors, not non-medically-trained managers. The Mayo and Cleveland clinics sit consistently at No 1 and No 2 in global healthcare rankings. Notably, both have, since their inception in 1864 and 1921 respectively, been led only by doctors. Naturally, they also provide doctors with good training in leadership and management. Having researched this area of leadership for 20 years, I suggest to Sir Jim that if he wants improved patient care, reduced waiting lists, efficiencies, and innovation through a greater use of AI and health tech, he gives more decision-making powers and responsibility to outstanding doctors, and other clinicians, who understand the core business of healthcare, medicine and the NHS.Amanda GoodallProfessor of leadership, Bayes Business School Have an opinion on anything youve read in the Guardian today?

New Mexico reports 30 measles cases including possible second US death,"All cases were in Lea county, near the county in Texas where more than 100 cases and one death have been recorded The New Mexico health department reported 30 measles cases in the state on Friday, an increase of 20 cases from its previous count. All the cases were reported in Lea county, which is located adjacent to Gaines county, Texas, where nearly 200 cases since late January and one death of an unvaccinated child have been reported, according to new data released on Friday. The increase in the reported cases comes a day after a deceased resident of New Mexico tested positive for measles, marking the second measles-related death in the United States in this outbreak. The unvaccinated adult patient did not seek any medical care before their death, and the cause of the death was still under investigation by the state medical examiner. Half of the patients in New Mexico are 18 years of age or older, data from the state health department showed on Friday. Three of the patients are up to four years of age and eight patients are between five and 17 years old. The outbreak, one of the largest the United States has seen in the past decade, has put the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine skeptic, to the test.

View from the couch: therapists on sessions in new Trump era,"Some mental health professionals are incorporating political views into the healing process: I want to let them know its really safe In his conversations with trans clients, Will Williams, a therapist in Oakland, California, sees the psychic toll exacted by the fusillade of recent executive orders targeting transgender protections. Many of his patients are filled with fear  and for legitimate reasons. In the days after Donald Trump took office, the administration required passports to be marked with sex assigned at birth, banned trans people from serving in the military and cut funding for gender-affirming care. On some federal websites, the T was removed from LGBT. Theres this literal embodied experience of Oh Im a target, said Williams, who is trans. We are the 1 that is going to be targeted and blamed, and when it comes down from the theoretical into daily life  psychically theres an experience of being erased. When clients ask him Do I even exist?, Williams can at least offer some comfort. He asks: How is it to be in a room with another trans person? The question makes plain what is in front of them: yes, they both exist. The medicine is in that, Williams says. Trump can say the moon doesnt exist anymore, but the moon still shines, and it still waxes and wanes. Williams is among the many therapists who are figuring out how to navigate a profession that has been plunged into uncharted territory during a tense second Trump term. Its a new atmosphere, and therapists say they are learning beside their clients as they go. Many of those who spoke with the Guardian requested anonymity so they could speak freely about sensitive issues. Liberal therapists say they sometimes incorporate their political views into the healing process to provide support for clients distressed by Trumps actions. Youre taught in school that therapists arent supposed to be political, but its very political, one liberal practitioner said. Now, at least in my therapist friend group, were like, Screw that, no, this is very political. Trumps policies, such as deporting immigrants, go against therapists code of ethics that requires them to uphold clients dignity and worth, she said. That hasnt precluded her from working with Trump-supporting clients. Some dont return and thats OK, but she successfully works with a range of conservative patients. On the other end of the spectrum, some therapists say they are encountering liberal clients who are fearful of coming to therapy: They want to know if their therapist voted against their human rights. Providing assurance to anxious clients is an instance in which many are choosing to share their political views. When appropriate, I want to let them know that its really safe, one therapist said. The relationship between liberal therapists and conservative clients has demanded a slight revision of therapeutic calculus. A few said they find themselves revolted by their clients beliefs but figure out how to work with them effectively despite...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/07/therapist-trump-politics-mental-health,2025-03-08
Is apple cider vinegar actually good for you?,"People have long claimed it can help with weight loss and digestive issues. But what does the science say? The popular new Netflix show Apple Cider Vinegar isnt about the titular vinegar  its about the influencer Belle Gibson claiming she cured brain cancer by adopting a whole food diet. Yet apple cider vinegar is a fitting symbol for societys obsession with miracle health cures. For millennia, healers, herbalists and wellness enthusiasts of all stripes have sworn by apple cider vinegars supposed benefits. Search apple cider vinegar  insert ailment and youll find someone claiming it helps with everything from sunburn to kidney stones to even neurodegenerative disease. Infused with garlic, onions and hot peppers, it becomes fire cider, a folk remedy said to boost immunity and take the edge off colds. A few tablespoons mixed into water? A digestive aid. Dabbed on to bruises? A home remedy. Many of the health claims people make about apple cider vinegar are based on anecdote and tradition. But some of its applications draw on clinical research and are considered worthwhile by doctors and dietitians. So what does the science really say about apple cider vinegars health effects and practical uses? Apple cider vinegar is neither magic nor snake oil. Rather, its a healthy pantry staple most people can incorporate into their diets safely. Unpasteurized apple cider vinegar with the mother, a brownish murk of friendly microbes, is rich in polyphenols, a kind of antioxidant, and probiotics, which contribute to beneficial gut bacteria. The typical serving recommendation is a tablespoon of vinegar diluted in 8oz of water. Effects will depend on the individual. For those with acid reflux, ulcers or gastritis, vinegars high levels of acetic acid may feel too harsh. As with any supplement, its a good idea to talk to your doctor before incorporating apple cider vinegar into your routine, particularly for those on diabetes medications or drugs that affect potassium levels, or those with kidney disease, as their kidneys may struggle to process high doses of acid. Its also worth noting that acid can be hard on tooth enamel. Apple cider vinegar is anti-microbial against pathogens, which means it can do double-duty as a salad dressing ingredient and a sanitizer for any sneaky E coli hanging out on your lettuce. Adding it to a bowl of water when washing produce can help kill off microbes, and keep your veg fresh for longer in the fridge. More research is needed before we know whether vinegar can be officially recommended for fighting pathogens inside the body, but the research so far paints a compelling picture of an accessible way to inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. Much of the research about drinking apple cider vinegar to control blood sugar has comprised only small, short, interventional trials. One 2023 study, with a cohort of 80 adults with type 2 diabetes, found that those who consumed two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar a day had significantly greater redu...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/07/apple-cider-vinegar-is-it-good,2025-03-08
CDC to study potential links between vaccines and autism despite research showing no connection,"Its unknown whether Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has promoted anti-vaccine views, is involved in study The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is planning a large study into potential connections between vaccines and autism, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, despite extensive scientific research that has disproved or failed to find evidence of such links. It is unclear whether the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has long promoted anti-vaccine views, is involved in the planned CDC study or how it would be carried out. The CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services were not immediately available for comment. The CDCs move comes amid one of the largest measles outbreaks the US has seen in the past decade, with more than 150 cases and two deaths in Texas and New Mexico. The outbreak has been fueled by declining vaccination rates in parts of the United States where parents have been falsely persuaded that such shots do more harm than good. Kennedy, whose role includes authority over the CDC, has long sowed doubt over the safety of the combined vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). In a cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy initially downplayed news that a school-aged child who was unvaccinated had died of measles in Texas, the first such death in a decade, calling such outbreaks ordinary and failing to mention the role of vaccination to prevent measles. Over the weekend, Kennedy published an opinion piece on the rightwing media outlet Fox News that promoted the role of vaccination, but also told parents vaccination was a personal choice and urged them to consult their physician. Kennedy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Autism diagnoses in the United States have increased significantly since 2000, intensifying public concern. Many researchers attribute the rise in diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a broader range of behaviors to describe the condition. But some public figures have popularized the idea that vaccines are to blame, an idea stemming from a since-debunked study from the British researcher Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s that connected a rise in autism diagnoses with widespread use of the MMR shot for babies. The causes of autism are unclear. No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or medications, or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde. Donald Trump, in an address to Congress this week, cited the rise in autism among children. So, were going to find out what it is, and theres nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you, Trump said, referring to Kennedy. Kennedys anti-vaccine views have drawn concern among some Republicans. During Kennedys confirmation hearing Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican senator and physician, suggested that the nominee disavow any links between vaccines and autism. Kennedy denied that he was anti-vaccine, but did not acknowledge that such a link ha...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/cdc-study-vaccines-autism,2025-03-08
"Tory peer introduced PPE firm to government after Cameron text, Covid inquiry hears","Inquiry looks at contracts worth 50m awarded to company linked to Lord Chadlington after he emailed DHSC adviser A Conservative peer introduced a company he was involved in to the government to supply PPE after he first contacted David Cameron by text message, the Covid-19 public inquiry has heard. The inquiry is hearing evidence this week about the governments multibillion-pound spending on medical supplies during the crisis, including its use of the VIP lane, which gave high priority to companies with political connections and awarded them 3.8bn PPE contracts. The inquiry is considering two contracts worth 50m awarded to SG Recruitment to illustrate how the VIP lane worked. The first contract was awarded just one week after the Tory peer, Peter Gummer, whose peerage title is Lord Chadlington, approached Cameron. Chadlington was the chair and a shareholder in the parent company, Sumner Group Holdings (SGH), registered in Jersey. Emails and messages published by the inquiry in a written submission showed that Cameron gave Chadlington the phone number for another Tory peer, Andrew Feldman, a close friend of the former prime ministers, who was advising the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on PPE procurement. On the same day Chadlington texted Feldman, writing: Andrew. I work with company with PPE. D says you are helping. Shall I put you in touch? Peter. Feldman replied positively, and gave Chadlington his new DHSC email address. Chadlington then sent an email introducing Feldman to David Sumner, the majority shareholder and chief executive of SGH, which was disclosed to the Guardian in response to a freedom of information request. David, Chadlington wrote, addressing Sumner, copying them both in. This is my friend Andrew Feldman. He can help you with PPE we discussed this morning. Drop me off chain. Peter. Sumner followed up by writing to Feldman offering to supply PPE, which Feldman forwarded to civil servants operating the VIP lane. Feldman told them it was: An interesting offer from David Sumner, who was introduced to me by Lord Chadlington. The emails published this week by the Covid inquiry show that Sumner updated Chadlington, who replied with encouragement, telling Sumner on 21 April 2020: Excellent. Looks like you have an inside track. Good luck. On 26 April 2020, Chadlington wrote to Sumner: I should  talk to DC David Cameron and to Feldman  theyve been batting for us on this and I want to say thanks for support. A week after Chadlingtons first approach to Cameron, the DHSC awarded SG Recruitment a contract for 23.9m, to supply coveralls. Then on 28 May 2020, the company was awarded a second contract, for 26.1m, to supply hand sanitiser. When the second contract was signed, Sumner sent a WhatsApp message to Chadlington, saying: Hand sanitizer contract in and signed! 135m of revenue under contract from DHSC for the two contracts! Chadlington replied saying: Great news, and indicated this would boost the companys share price.

Britons snacking less as they drift back to office after pandemic,"People snacked at home on more than 15 fewer occasions in 2024 than in 2020 and are choosing healthier options Hold the biscuits, popcorn and chocolate and hand out the rice cakes, apples and halloumi, the UK is cutting back on snacks and shifting to healthier options amid tighter budgets and bulging waistlines. Britons had a snack at home on more than 15 fewer occasions in 2024 than in 2020  as a boom in self-treating during the pandemic lockdowns subsided, according to the retail market analysts Kantar. Even when snacking on the go is included, we are munching about 2 less than during the pandemic and even a bit less than before Covid reshaped our lives. Nathan Ward from Kantar said: Working from home has made a massive difference. During the pandemic we did snack more as we were in the home and availability does drive consumption. As people have drifted back to work snacking has declined. Ananda Roy, at the market research firm Circana, said: We are seeing the world return to normal. He says treats are far from off the menu but the future of snacking is going to be different with more fruit, nuts, yoghurts, protein bars and cheese, and fewer chocolatey treats and biscuits. Last year, we snacked on 350m fewer occasions at home compared with the previous year, according to Kantar. Consumers bought about 1.5 fewer sweets and chocolate bars over the year, according to Circana data, and about 6 fewer packs of crisps than in 2021. In contrast, snacking on fruit was up 4 last year, according to Kantar, while we bought 1.2 more nuts and 16 more protein bars, drinks and powders, according to the Grocers top products research with the analyst NIQ. Protein snacks are experiencing a particular boost from healthy eating trends, with special drinks, nuts and even boiled eggs now more popular, as well as foods with more fibre, such as low-sugar smoothies. Waitrose said it had seen a demand for more functional snacks, such as crispy seaweed, as customers sought out healthier foods. Households are also seeking out less processed treats  such as carrot sticks, apple slices, olives and salads  amid concerns about the health implications of ultra-processed foods. Increasingly, consumers are using fresh fruit and vegetables as part of their snack repertoire, Roy said. The rise in the cost of cocoa, sugar and other indulgent commodities is partly behind the shift, with the amount of chocolate bought down by 11 since 2021, according to Circana. Crisp sales have also been hit by price rises prompted by poor potato harvests. The UKs biggest brand, Walkers, for instance, sold 2.6m fewer kilograms of crisps last year as average prices increased 4.1 according to the Grocer. Jonny Forsyth, a senior director of food and drink research at Mintel, said: The elevated cost of living has dampened sales of snacks. Rules that forced supermarkets to display high fat and sugar foods in less prominent positions from October 2022 have also had an impact. The changes have not only mad...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/07/britons-snacking-less-as-they-drift-back-to-office-after-pandemic,2025-03-08
Two non-profits in Ohio are settling some of the $220bn in US medical debt,"Spouses of deceased Medicaid recipients report repayment demands for medical costs, trapping them in a cycle of debt After her husband of 44 years died two years ago from Covid-19-related respiratory complications, Susan thought she could begin to grieve the loss of her best friend. The cost of the medical care her husband incurred before he died, she was told, was not something she had to think about. Medicaid paid everything off. Everything was good, the resident of Springfield, Ohio, who asked not to be fully identified due to her outstanding legal matters, says. Then her attorney called her to say the Medicaid bill needed to be paid. I said: What Medicaid bill? The hospital bill has been paid. The attorney said: No, you have to pay it back to the state. The hospital had previously shown her a printout of the bill having been paid in full. Ive been in limbo for two years. It has been a burden. I lose sleep over it, she says. Every time I try to do something its like running into a brick wall. About 100 million Americans owe an estimated 220bn in medical debt, with many dragging those financial obligations around for decades. Millions of low-income Americans have been trapped by medical debt that has prevented them from owning a car or house, keeping them and their spouses and children in poverty for generations. But in south-west Ohio, local activists and medical centers are teaming up with Undue Medical Debt, a Boston-based non-profit formerly called RIP Medical Debt, on an ambitious effort to raise funding to settle longstanding medical bills for thousands of locals. In a region with some of the highest medical debt rates in the country, about 13,000 people who owe more than 22m are eligible for debt relief, which can be bought from debt collecting agencies at a knockdown rate of 1 for 178 of debt. Its a very troubling story when you hear patients who defer care because they are worried about the cost of healthcare. People fall through the cracks; they are in insurance doughnut holes, their insurers deny their prior authorizations that were approved, says Ben Merick of Bon Secours Mercy Health in Springfield, Ohio, one of the entities helping with the campaign. Our hope is for a reset. Our goal is to raise money in Clark county to clear this debt, which is a pretty substantial amount of money per capita in our county. Undue Medical Debt does not take requests or unburdens debt from individuals; rather it acquires bundled portfolios of debt whose owners are willing to sell. In theory, Susans debt could be eliminated by a 264 donation. Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in the US even as many other developed and developing countries provide universal healthcare in one guise or another to residents. In 2020, Ohioans paid more per capita for healthcare than residents in California, Washington state and Texas, despite income levels in the latter states being far higher. For the plan to work, the project, led by a local non-profit cal...",Health,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/ohio-medical-debt-repayment-non-profits,2025-03-08
"Sizing up: how stadiums, hospitals and airlines are adapting to rise in obesity","Extra-width spectator seating, bariatric ambulances and oversized coffins are in growing demand More than half of adults will be overweight or obese by 2050  report With a study predicting that by 2050 more than half of adults and a third of children and young people worldwide will be overweight or obese, a swathe of industries are adapting to accommodate larger bodies. From hospitals to transport, stadiums to crematoriums, here are some of the adjustments being made. At the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil, organisers said 1,675 seats had been reserved for obese people or people with disabilities  the first time tickets for obese people were offered at a Fifa event. To qualify for a ticket, people were required to submit a medical certificate saying they had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. Providing seats for larger football fans is now standard practice at major matches, with Fifas stadium guidelines stating that easy access extra-width seating for obese adults or those with limited mobility should be available. These should be as wide as two standard general admission seats and be able to support a weight of 250kg (39st 5lb). Over the past decade, ambulance services have invested significant sums in bariatric ambulances, designed and equipped to deal with patients over 158kg (25st), in response to a rise in obesity-related hospital visits. These usually have double-width trolley stretchers, heavy-duty wheelchairs and reinforced tail-lifts. Other vehicles have been fitted with lifts, hoists and larger stretchers to help transport bigger patients. The Times reported that the NHS spent 10m on bariatric equipment in 2021-22, up from 5m in 2018-19. This was for specific beds and mortuary fridges for obese people, as well as larger wheelchairs and crutches with higher weight limits. In 2022-23 there were a record 1.2m obesity-related NHS hospital admissions, almost double the number of five years previously. Airlines are increasingly trying to squeeze more passengers on to flights as they respond to rising demand, and aeroplane seats are getting smaller as a result. Some airlines have rebranded their seats as slimline  in Air Canadas introduction of slimline seats, widths dropped from 47cm (18.5ins) to 43cm. As a result, plane travel has become increasingly difficult for obese passengers, with many airlines suggesting larger passengers book two seats instead of one, often at full price, and offering seatbelt extensions. Although not specifically targeted at larger passengers, Ryanair allows flyers to book two flight tickets, one under the name extra comfort seat, giving them the width of two seats and more personal space. Air France offers a 25 discount on extra seats for larger-bodied passengers if the width of the seat is not sufficient. Under Canadian airline rules, obese passengers travelling domestically can request an extra seat free of charge if they provide their BMI, height, weight and seated width measurements.

"Ministers delaying inquiry into treatment of migrant carers, RCN says","Exclusive: Nursing union says it continues to receive complaints about low pay, unfit housing and illegal fees Ministers are dragging their heels on an investigation into the mistreatment of migrant carers, the countrys largest nursing union has said, as it continues to receive complaints about low pay, substandard accommodation and illegal fees. Nicola Ranger, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, has written to Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, to urge her to speed up her promised investigation into the abuse of foreign care workers. Despite the governments promises to clamp down on abusive practices by rogue employers and agencies, the RCN says it continues to receive more than 100 calls a year from nurses who say they are being mistreated. Ranger said in her letter: The RCN is deeply concerned by reports of exploitative workplace practices that many international educated nursing staff in the care sector face. Our members report a range of issues from long working hours, excessive repayment fees to exit contracts, substandard and crowded accommodation, and illegal work finding fees. Cooper promised last June to hold an investigation into the experiences of people coming to the UK to work in the social care sector, after the Guardian uncovered widespread allegations of mistreatment. The investigation showed how dozens of migrant nurses had been induced to pay tens of thousands of pounds for their visas on the promise of a job, only to find little or no work when they arrived. Some were sharing rooms, and even beds, with other migrant workers, to make ends meet. The problems stem from the decision by the previous government to relax the rules around sponsoring care worker visas, which ministers took in response to a staffing crisis in social care. Cooper said at the time the Guardians revelations were a disgrace, adding: There must be a full investigation into these reports to ensure standards are upheld, and exploitative employers are prosecuted. Since winning the election, Labour has indicated it will conduct this investigation through a new employment regulator which ministers are setting up as part of the employment rights bill. The government is yet to decide the exact remit for the new regulator, however, suggesting it will take several more months to establish. Ranger said in her letter: I am concerned that based on current timelines, the creation of the single enforcement body  subject to the passing of the employment rights bill  will not be until spring 2026 at the earliest. A subsequent investigation is likely to take several months to conclude.

"Adult infected with measles dies in New Mexico, health officials say","Person from Lea county had been unvaccinated and did not seek care but virus not yet confirmed as cause of death An adult who was infected with measles has died in New Mexico, state health officials announced Thursday, though the virus has not been confirmed as the cause of death. The person who died had been unvaccinated and did not seek medical care, a state health department spokesperson said in a statement. The persons exact age and other details were not immediately released. The person was from Lea county, just across the state line from the west Texas region where 159 measles cases have been identified and a school-age child died last week  the first US measles death in a decade. New Mexico health officials have not linked the outbreak there to the Texas cases. The person was the 10th in Lea county to have had a confirmed measles infection. Seven were unvaccinated. The vaccination status of the other three people is unknown. Six of the cases were in adults and the rest were in children younger than 17. On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that they were sending a team to Texas to help local public health officials respond to the outbreak, which began in late January. Measles  one of the most infectious diseases in the world  is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children aged 12-15 months, and the second for those aged four to six. We dont want to see New Mexicans getting sick or dying from measles, said Dr Chad Smelser, the deputy state epidemiologist. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is the best protection against this serious disease. The crisis in Texas comes as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) transitions under the leadership of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a well-known vaccine skeptic. Kennedy has long promoted the discredited theory linking childhood vaccinations to autism. One of his first actions in office was to postpone a public meeting on immunization. Kennedy raised alarm among pediatricians, vaccine experts and lawmakers after publishing an opinion piece that focused on vitamin A and nutrition as treatments for measles and did not endorse vaccines. In response to the Texas measles outbreak, Kennedy wrote for Fox News about the benefits of good nutrition and vitamin A, but did not explicitly recommend highly effective vaccines.

Next boss of NHS England prepares purge of senior leadership team,"Exclusive: Jim Mackey plans big clearout as he steers NHS England towards closer relationship with health secretary The next boss of NHS England is preparing a wide-ranging purge of its senior leadership team as he steers it into a much closer relationship with the health secretary, Wes Streeting. Sir Jim Mackey, NHS Englands chief executive, is finalising plans for a big clearout of the top executives who were mainly hired by his immediate predecessor, Amanda Pritchard, who will leave the post in April. Mackeys purge will lead to the departure of many of the organisations most senior high-level managers, with only a handful expected to survive, well-placed sources say. Pritchard surprised the service last week when she resigned after holding talks with Streeting over her and the organisations future role. Prof Sir Steve Powis, NHS Englands national medical director and best-known other public face behind Pritchard, followed suit on Thursday by announcing that he too is standing down. The 64-year-old became well known in the early days of Covid-19 in spring 2020 when he advised ministers on how to handle the virus and appeared regularly at televised media briefings at 10 Downing Street. Theres a changing of the guard in the NHS and thats really just begun, said a senior source, referring to Pritchard and Powiss impending exits. Mackey will oversee a substantive clearout of the exec team, with more casualties than survivors, a second source added. Sarah-Jane Marsh, NHS Englands deputy chief operating officer and national director of urgent and emergency care, is likely to remain in her post. Mackey, an accountant by background, is also weighing up whether to axe Julian Kelly, the deputy chief executive and chief financial officer. Kelly, who is widely respected, does what some see as probably the toughest job in Whitehall  trying to make the NHSs near-200bn annual budget meet its needs while reassuring ministers that it is spending it wisely. His future remains unclear. A source familiar with Mackeys thinking said: It will be a pretty total clearout. And theres an appetite in some quarters to move Julian Kelly on as part of that. But if youre going to replace the guy whos in effect the financial controller of a 200bn budget, you need to know what you are doing before you get rid of him. Jim will want his own person in that job, but at the same time its a risky time to get someone new in, given the NHSs finances are in a poor state. Kelly is respected at the Treasury, where he used to be its director general of public spending and finance. However, he has risked irritating ministers by warning at recent NHS England board meetings that the 22bn extra Rachel Reeves has given the health service over the next two years will be swallowed up by pay rises and not be enough to pay for the radical transformation of how care is delivered, through three big shifts that Streeting and Keir Starmer have promised.

"Crap jobs, fewer homes, less money, toxic politics. And peak happiness eludes the young: who knew? | Zoe Williams","Given recent history and the state of the world now, perhaps the thing that makes older people happiest is not being under 45 So there are two studies, one commissioned by Weetabix, one by the UN, but we dont need to decide which one is likely to be the more reliable because, praise be, they both say the same thing: 45 is now the age of peak happiness. A massive 77 are more content with their lives after they hit 40, with two-thirds saying they no longer cared what other people thought, and 59 having attained self-actualisation  or, at least, they say they now know what really matters in life. Which is probably about as self-actualised as it gets. That data is all from the high-fibre breakfast treat funded study. The UN, meanwhile, has survey results from the UK, Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and kicks off cheerfully enough  happiness used to be conceived in a U-shape, when it was bliss to be alive in youth, miserable in middle age, and then picked up again as you got older. Now its more of a straight upward trajectory, although that cant literally be true as it would make babies the saddest people on Earth. Fair play, they do cry a lot. The problem with the UNs research is that its pretty clear about whats driving this change, and  newsflash  it isnt pilates. The economist David Blanchflower, co-author with the academic psychologist Jean Twenge, is blunt: theres a crisis in wellbeing among the young. Theyve become isolated, they dont go out, theyre not carefree, they dont have sex. Separate research has demonstrated, repeatedly, that theres a mental health crisis in the under-35s, with more than 500,000 excluded from the workforce. The proportion of young people out of work owing to mental health problems has nearly doubled since 2012. Its possible that people hit peak happiness at 45 just by dint of the tremendous good fortune of not being younger than 45. There are so many explanations for this that crumble as soon as you pick them up. Covid is often thought to have hit the young harder: it disrupted school and warped exam results; those at university paid the price for the best years of their lives without actually enjoying them; those just starting work missed out on the comradeship and knowledge-sharing of offices. Blanchflower contends that the trend started before 2020, however, and didnt end when normal life resumed  so it must be something else, maybe social media use, cyberbullying, online body shaming. Trying to make sense of that, people in their 40s and 50s often fall back on the snowflake hypothesis. If these features of modern life  which the rest of us manage OK  have overwhelmed one generation, maybe theyre just not robust? Too hung up on identity politics, too easily offended, too ready to protest over offence theyve taken, too keen to diagnose themselves with things, and then too strident in asking for allowances  just too fragile for the world.
